| <CopyableCode code="get_package_for_organization" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="org, package_name, package_type" /> | Gets a specific package in an organization.<br /><br />To use this endpoint, you must authenticate using an access token with the `read:packages` scope. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, your token must also include the `repo` scope. For the list of GitHub Packages registries that only support repository-scoped permissions, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)." |
| <CopyableCode code="list_packages_for_organization" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="org, package_type" /> | Lists packages in an organization readable by the user.<br /><br />To use this endpoint, you must authenticate using an access token with the `read:packages` scope. If the `package_type` belongs to a registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, your token must also include the `repo` scope. For the list of GitHub Packages registries that only support repository-scoped permissions, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)." |
| <CopyableCode code="delete_package_for_org" /> | `DELETE` | <CopyableCode code="org, package_name, package_type" /> | Deletes an entire package in an organization. You cannot delete a public package if any version of the package has more than 5,000 downloads. In this scenario, contact GitHub support for further assistance.<br /><br />To use this endpoint, you must have admin permissions in the organization and authenticate using an access token with the `read:packages` and `delete:packages` scopes.

For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."<br />- If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that supports granular permissions, you must have admin permissions to the package you want to delete. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)." |
| <CopyableCode code="restore_package_for_org" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="org, package_name, package_type" /> | Restores an entire package in an organization.<br /><br />You can restore a deleted package under the following conditions:<br />  - The package was deleted within the last 30 days.<br />  - The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.<br /><br />To use this endpoint, you must have admin permissions in the organization and authenticate using an access token with the `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes.
