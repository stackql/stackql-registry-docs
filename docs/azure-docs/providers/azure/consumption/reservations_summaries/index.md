|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `list` | `SELECT` | `grain, resourceScope` | Lists the reservations summaries for the defined scope daily or monthly grain. Note: ARM has a payload size limit of 12MB, so currently callers get 400 when the response size exceeds the ARM limit. In such cases, API call should be made with smaller date ranges. |
| `list_by_reservation_order` | `SELECT` | `grain, reservationOrderId` | Lists the reservations summaries for daily or monthly grain. Note: ARM has a payload size limit of 12MB, so currently callers get 400 when the response size exceeds the ARM limit. In such cases, API call should be made with smaller date ranges. |
| `list_by_reservation_order_and_reservation` | `SELECT` | `grain, reservationId, reservationOrderId` | Lists the reservations summaries for daily or monthly grain. Note: ARM has a payload size limit of 12MB, so currently callers get 400 when the response size exceeds the ARM limit. In such cases, API call should be made with smaller date ranges. |
