<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td>Resource</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><CopyableCode code="azure.consumption.reservations_details" /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="id" /> | `string` | The full qualified ARM ID of an event. |
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | The ID that uniquely identifies an event. |
| <CopyableCode code="etag" /> | `string` | The etag for the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="properties" /> | `object` | The properties of the reservation detail. |
| <CopyableCode code="tags" /> | `object` | Resource tags. |
| <CopyableCode code="type" /> | `string` | Resource type. |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="resourceScope" /> | Lists the reservations details for provided date range. Note: ARM has a payload size limit of 12MB, so currently callers get 400 when the response size exceeds the ARM limit. If the data size is too large, customers may also get 504 as the API timed out preparing the data. In such cases, API call should be made with smaller date ranges or a call to Generate Reservation Details Report API should be made as it is asynchronous and will not run into response size time outs. |
| <CopyableCode code="list_by_reservation_order" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="$filter, reservationOrderId" /> | Lists the reservations details for provided date range. Note: ARM has a payload size limit of 12MB, so currently callers get 400 when the response size exceeds the ARM limit. If the data size is too large, customers may also get 504 as the API timed out preparing the data. In such cases, API call should be made with smaller date ranges or a call to Generate Reservation Details Report API should be made as it is asynchronous and will not run into response size time outs. |
| <CopyableCode code="list_by_reservation_order_and_reservation" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="$filter, reservationId, reservationOrderId" /> | Lists the reservations details for provided date range. Note: ARM has a payload size limit of 12MB, so currently callers get 400 when the response size exceeds the ARM limit. If the data size is too large, customers may also get 504 as the API timed out preparing the data. In such cases, API call should be made with smaller date ranges or a call to Generate Reservation Details Report API should be made as it is asynchronous and will not run into response size time outs. |

## `SELECT` examples

Lists the reservations details for provided date range. Note: ARM has a payload size limit of 12MB, so currently callers get 400 when the response size exceeds the ARM limit. If the data size is too large, customers may also get 504 as the API timed out preparing the data. In such cases, API call should be made with smaller date ranges or a call to Generate Reservation Details Report API should be made as it is asynchronous and will not run into response size time outs.
