## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | `integer` | This Linode's ID which must be provided for all operations impacting this Linode.<br /> |
| `created` | `string` | When this Linode was created. |
| `host_uuid` | `string` | The Linode's host machine, as a UUID. |
| `region` | `string` | This is the [Region](/docs/api/regions/#regions-list) where the Linode was deployed. A Linode's region can only be changed by initiating a [cross data center migration](/docs/api/linode-instances/#dc-migrationpending-host-migration-initiate).<br /> |
| `ipv4` | `array` | This Linode's IPv4 Addresses. Each Linode is assigned a single public IPv4 address<br />upon creation, and may get a single private IPv4 address if needed. You may need to<br />[open a support ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)<br />to get additional IPv4 addresses.<br /><br />IPv4 addresses may be reassigned between your Linodes, or shared with other Linodes.<br />See the [/networking](/docs/api/networking/) endpoints for details.<br /> |
| `backups` | `object` | Information about this Linode's backups status. For information about available backups, see [/linode/instances/&#123;linodeId&#125;/backups](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backups-list).<br /> |
| `label` | `string` | The Linode's label is for display purposes only. If no label is provided for a Linode,<br />a default will be assigned.<br /><br />Linode labels have the following constraints:<br /><br />  * Must begin and end with an alphanumeric character.<br />  * May only consist of alphanumeric characters, dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`) or periods (`.`).<br />  * Cannot have two dashes (`--`), underscores (`__`) or periods (`..`) in a row.<br /> |
| `status` | `string` | A brief description of this Linode's current state. This field may change without direct action from you. For example, when a Linode goes into maintenance mode its status will display "stopped".<br /> |
| `specs` | `object` | Information about the resources available to this Linode. |
| `updated` | `string` | When this Linode was last updated. |
| `ipv6` | `string` | This Linode's IPv6 SLAAC address. This address is specific to a Linode, and may not be shared. If the Linode has not been assigned an IPv6 address, the return value will be `null`.<br /> |
| `watchdog_enabled` | `boolean` | The watchdog, named Lassie, is a Shutdown Watchdog that monitors your Linode and will reboot it if it powers off unexpectedly. It works by issuing a boot job when your Linode powers off without a shutdown job being responsible.<br />To prevent a loop, Lassie will give up if there have been more than 5 boot jobs issued within 15 minutes.<br /> |
| `group` | `string` | A deprecated property denoting a group label for this Linode.<br /> |
| `tags` | `array` | An array of tags applied to this object.  Tags are for organizational purposes only.<br /> |
| `type` | `string` | This is the [Linode Type](/docs/api/linode-types/#types-list) that this Linode was deployed with.<br />To change a Linode's Type, use [POST /linode/instances/&#123;linodeId&#125;/resize](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-resize).<br /> |
| `image` | `string` | An Image ID to deploy the Linode Disk from.<br /><br />Access the Images List ([GET /images](/docs/api/images/#images-list)) endpoint with authentication to view<br />all available Images. Official Linode Images start with `linode/`, while your Account's Images start with `private/`. Creating<br />a disk from a Private Image requires `read_only` or `read_write` permissions for that Image. Access the User's<br />Grant Update ([PUT /account/users/&#123;username&#125;/grants](/docs/api/account/#users-grants-update)) endpoint to<br />adjust permissions for an Account Image.<br /> |
| `hypervisor` | `string` | The virtualization software powering this Linode.<br /> |
| `alerts` | `object` |  |

| `createLinodeInstance` | `INSERT` | `data__region, data__type` | Creates a Linode Instance on your Account. In order for this<br />request to complete successfully, your User must have the `add_linodes` grant. Creating a<br />new Linode will incur a charge on your Account.<br /><br />Linodes can be created using one of the available Types. See<br />Types List ([GET /linode/types](/docs/api/linode-types/#types-list)) to get more<br />information about each Type's specs and cost.<br /><br />Linodes can be created in any one of our available Regions, which are accessible from the<br />Regions List ([GET /regions](/docs/api/regions/#regions-list)) endpoint.<br /><br />In an effort to fight spam, Linode restricts outbound connections on ports 25, 465, and 587<br />on all Linodes for new accounts created after November 5th, 2019. For more information,<br />see [Sending Email on Linode](/docs/guides/running-a-mail-server/#sending-email-on-linode).<br /><br />Linodes can be created in a number of ways:<br /><br />* Using a Linode Public Image distribution or a Private Image you created based on another Linode.<br />  * Access the Images List ([GET /images](/docs/api/images/#images-list)) endpoint with authentication to view<br />    all available Images.<br />  * The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.<br />  * A default config with two Disks, one being a 512 swap disk, is created.<br />    * `swap_size` can be used to customize the swap disk size.<br />  * Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.<br />  * It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.<br />  * You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.<br />    * These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first. See SSH Key Add ([POST /profile/sshkeys](/docs/api/profile/#ssh-key-add)) for more information.<br /><br />* Using a StackScript.<br />  * See StackScripts List ([GET /linode/stackscripts](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscripts-list)) for<br />    a list of available StackScripts.<br />  * The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.<br />  * Requires a compatible Image to be supplied.<br />    * See StackScript View ([GET /linode/stackscript/&#123;stackscriptId&#125;](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscript-view)) for compatible Images.<br />  * Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.<br />  * It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.<br />  * You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.<br />    * These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first. See SSH Key Add ([POST /profile/sshkeys](/docs/api/profile/#ssh-key-add)) for more information.<br /><br />* Using one of your other Linode's backups.<br />  * You must create a Linode large enough to accommodate the Backup's size.<br />  * The Disks and Config will match that of the Linode that was backed up.<br />  * The `root_pass` will match that of the Linode that was backed up.<br /><br />* Attached to a private VLAN.<br />  * Review the `interfaces` property of the [Request Body Schema](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create__request-body-schema) for details.<br />  * For more information, see our guide on [Getting Started with VLANs](/docs/products/networking/vlans/get-started/).<br /><br />* Create an empty Linode.<br />  * The Linode will remain `offline` and must be manually started.<br />    * See Linode Boot ([POST /linode/instances/&#123;linodeId&#125;/boot](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-boot)).<br />  * Disks and Configs must be created manually.<br />  * This is only recommended for advanced use cases.<br /><br />**Important**: You must be an unrestricted User in order to add or modify<br />tags on Linodes.<br /> |
| `deleteLinodeInstance` | `DELETE` | `linodeId` | Deletes a Linode you have permission to `read_write`.<br /><br />**Deleting a Linode is a destructive action and cannot be undone.**<br /><br />Additionally, deleting a Linode:<br /><br />  * Gives up any IP addresses the Linode was assigned.<br />  * Deletes all Disks, Backups, Configs, etc.<br />  * Stops billing for the Linode and its associated services. You will be billed for time used<br />    within the billing period the Linode was active.<br /><br />Linodes that are in the process of [cloning](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-clone) or [backup restoration](/docs/api/linode-instances/#backup-restore) cannot be deleted.<br /> |
| `_getLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | Get a specific Linode by ID. |
| `_getLinodeInstances` | `EXEC` |  | Returns a paginated list of Linodes you have permission to view.<br /> |
| `bootLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | Boots a Linode you have permission to modify. If no parameters are given, a Config profile<br />will be chosen for this boot based on the following criteria:<br /><br />* If there is only one Config profile for this Linode, it will be used.<br />* If there is more than one Config profile, the last booted config will be used.<br />* If there is more than one Config profile and none were the last to be booted (because the<br />  Linode was never booted or the last booted config was deleted) an error will be returned.<br /> |
| `cloneLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | You can clone your Linode's existing Disks or Configuration profiles to<br />another Linode on your Account. In order for this request to complete<br />successfully, your User must have the `add_linodes` grant. Cloning to a<br />new Linode will incur a charge on your Account.<br /><br />If cloning to an existing Linode, any actions currently running or<br />queued must be completed first before you can clone to it.<br /><br />Up to five clone operations from any given source Linode can be run concurrently.<br />If more concurrent clones are attempted, an HTTP 400 error will be<br />returned by this endpoint.<br /><br />Any [tags](/docs/api/tags/#tags-list) existing on the source Linode will be cloned to the target Linode.<br /> |
| `migrateLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | Initiate a pending host migration that has been scheduled by Linode or initiate a cross data center (DC) migration.  A list of pending migrations, if any, can be accessed from [GET /account/notifications](/docs/api/account/#notifications-list). When the migration begins, your Linode will be shutdown if not already off. If the migration initiated the shutdown, it will reboot the Linode when completed.<br /><br />To initiate a cross DC migration, you must pass a `region` parameter to the request body specifying the target data center region. You can view a list of all available regions and their feature capabilities from [GET /regions](/docs/api/regions/#regions-list). If your Linode has a DC migration already queued or you have initiated a previously scheduled migration, you will not be able to initiate a DC migration until it has completed.<br /><br />**Note:** Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers do not support IPv6 `/116` pools or IP Failover. If you have these features enabled on your Linode and attempt to migrate to an NGN data center, the migration will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.<br /> |
| `mutateLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | Linodes created with now-deprecated Types are entitled to a free upgrade to the next generation. A mutating Linode will be allocated any new resources the upgraded Type provides, and will be subsequently restarted if it was currently running.<br />If any actions are currently running or queued, those actions must be completed first before you can initiate a mutate.<br /> |
| `rebootLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | Reboots a Linode you have permission to modify. If any actions are currently running or queued, those actions must be completed first before you can initiate a reboot.<br /> |
| `rebuildLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId, data__image, data__root_pass` | Rebuilds a Linode you have the `read_write` permission to modify.<br />A rebuild will first shut down the Linode, delete all disks and configs on the Linode, and then deploy a new `image` to the Linode with the given attributes. Additionally:<br /><br />  * Requires an `image` be supplied.<br />  * Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.<br />  * It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the<br />    `authorized_keys` field.<br /> |
| `rescueLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | Rescue Mode is a safe environment for performing many system recovery and disk management tasks. Rescue Mode is based on the Finnix recovery distribution, a self-contained and bootable Linux distribution. You can also use Rescue Mode for tasks other than disaster recovery, such as formatting disks to use different filesystems, copying data between disks, and downloading files from a disk via SSH and SFTP.<br />* Note that "sdh" is reserved and unavailable during rescue.<br /> |
| `resetLinodePassword` | `EXEC` | `linodeId, data__root_pass` | Resets the root password for this Linode.<br />* Your Linode must be [shut down](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-shut-down) for a password reset to complete.<br />* If your Linode has more than one disk (not counting its swap disk), use the [Reset Disk Root Password](/docs/api/linode-instances/#disk-root-password-reset) endpoint to update a specific disk's root password.<br />* A `password_reset` event is generated when a root password reset is successful.<br /> |
| `resizeLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId, data__type` | Resizes a Linode you have the `read_write` permission to a different Type. If any actions are currently running or queued, those actions must be completed first before you can initiate a resize. Additionally, the following criteria must be met in order to resize a Linode:<br /><br />  * The Linode must not have a pending migration.<br />  * Your Account cannot have an outstanding balance.<br />  * The Linode must not have more disk allocation than the new Type allows.<br />    * In that situation, you must first delete or resize the disk to be smaller.<br /> |
| `shutdownLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | Shuts down a Linode you have permission to modify. If any actions are currently running or queued, those actions must be completed first before you can initiate a shutdown.<br /> |
| `updateLinodeInstance` | `EXEC` | `linodeId` | Updates a Linode that you have permission to `read_write`.<br /><br />**Important**: You must be an unrestricted User in order to add or modify tags on Linodes.<br /> |
