## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `getDatabasesPostgreSQLInstanceBackup` | `SELECT` | `backupId, instanceId` | Display information for a single backup for an accessible Managed PostgreSQL Database.<br /><br />The Database must not be provisioning to perform this command.<br /> |
| `getDatabasesPostgreSQLInstanceBackups` | `SELECT` | `instanceId` | Display all backups for an accessible Managed PostgreSQL Database.<br /><br />The Database must not be provisioning to perform this command.<br /><br />Database `auto` type backups are created every 24 hours at 0:00 UTC. Each `auto` backup is retained for 7 days.<br /><br />Database `snapshot` type backups are created by accessing the **Managed PostgreSQL Database Backup Snapshot Create** ([POST /databases/postgresql/instances/&#123;instanceId&#125;/backups](/docs/api/databases/#managed-postgresql-database-backup-snapshot-create)) command.<br /> |
| `deleteDatabasePostgreSQLInstanceBackup` | `DELETE` | `backupId, instanceId` | Delete a single backup for an accessible Managed PostgreSQL Database.<br /><br />Requires `read_write` access to the Database.<br /><br />The Database must not be provisioning to perform this command.<br /> |
| `_getDatabasesPostgreSQLInstanceBackup` | `EXEC` | `backupId, instanceId` | Display information for a single backup for an accessible Managed PostgreSQL Database.<br /><br />The Database must not be provisioning to perform this command.<br /> |
| `_getDatabasesPostgreSQLInstanceBackups` | `EXEC` | `instanceId` | Display all backups for an accessible Managed PostgreSQL Database.<br /><br />The Database must not be provisioning to perform this command.<br /><br />Database `auto` type backups are created every 24 hours at 0:00 UTC. Each `auto` backup is retained for 7 days.<br /><br />Database `snapshot` type backups are created by accessing the **Managed PostgreSQL Database Backup Snapshot Create** ([POST /databases/postgresql/instances/&#123;instanceId&#125;/backups](/docs/api/databases/#managed-postgresql-database-backup-snapshot-create)) command.<br /> |
| `postDatabasesPostgreSQLInstanceBackup` | `EXEC` | `instanceId, data__label` | Creates a snapshot backup of a Managed PostgreSQL Database.<br /><br />Requires `read_write` access to the Database.<br /><br />Up to 3 snapshot backups for each Database can be stored at a time. If 3 snapshots have been created for a Database, one must be deleted before another can be made.<br /><br />Backups generated by this command have the type `snapshot`. Snapshot backups may take several minutes to complete, after which they will be accessible to view or restore.<br /><br />The Database must have an `active` status to perform this command. If another backup is in progress, it must complete before a new backup can be initiated.<br /> |
| `postDatabasesPostgreSQLInstanceBackupRestore` | `EXEC` | `backupId, instanceId` | Restore a backup to a Managed PostgreSQL Database on your Account.<br /><br />Requires `read_write` access to the Database.<br /><br />The Database must have an `active` status to perform this command.<br /><br />**Note**: Restoring from a backup will erase all existing data on the database instance and replace it with backup data.<br /><br />**Note**: Currently, restoring a backup after resetting Managed Database credentials results in a failed cluster. Please contact Customer Support if this occurs.<br /> |
