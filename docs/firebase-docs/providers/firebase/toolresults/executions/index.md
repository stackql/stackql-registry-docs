## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `completionTime` | `object` | A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear). The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings. |
| `creationTime` | `object` | A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution.

| `dimensionDefinitions` | `array` | The dimensions along which different steps in this execution may vary. This must remain fixed over the life of the execution. Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if this field is set in an update request. Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if the same name occurs in more than one dimension_definition. Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if the size of the list is over 100. - In response: present if set by create - In create request: optional - In update request: never set |
| `executionId` | `string` | A unique identifier within a History for this Execution. Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if this field is set or overwritten by the caller. - In response always set - In create/update request: never set |
| `outcome` | `object` | Interprets a result so that humans and machines can act on it. |
| `specification` | `object` | The details about how to run the execution. |
| `state` | `string` | The initial state is IN_PROGRESS. The only legal state transitions is from IN_PROGRESS to COMPLETE. A PRECONDITION_FAILED will be returned if an invalid transition is requested. The state can only be set to COMPLETE once. A FAILED_PRECONDITION will be returned if the state is set to COMPLETE multiple times. If the state is set to COMPLETE, all the in-progress steps within the execution will be set as COMPLETE. If the outcome of the step is not set, the outcome will be set to INCONCLUSIVE. - In response always set - In create/update request: optional |
| `testExecutionMatrixId` | `string` | TestExecution Matrix ID that the TestExecutionService uses. - In response: present if set by create - In create: optional - In update: never set |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_histories_executions_get` | `SELECT` | `executionId, historyId, projectId` | Gets an Execution. May return any of the following canonical error codes: - PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to write to project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - NOT_FOUND - if the Execution does not exist |
| `projects_histories_executions_list` | `SELECT` | `historyId, projectId` | Lists Executions for a given History. The executions are sorted by creation_time in descending order. The execution_id key will be used to order the executions with the same creation_time. May return any of the following canonical error codes: - PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to read project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - NOT_FOUND - if the containing History does not exist |
| `projects_histories_executions_create` | `INSERT` | `historyId, projectId` | Creates an Execution. The returned Execution will have the id set. May return any of the following canonical error codes: - PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to write to project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - NOT_FOUND - if the containing History does not exist |
| `projects_histories_executions_patch` | `EXEC` | `executionId, historyId, projectId` | Updates an existing Execution with the supplied partial entity. May return any of the following canonical error codes: - PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to write to project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - FAILED_PRECONDITION - if the requested state transition is illegal - NOT_FOUND - if the containing History does not exist |
