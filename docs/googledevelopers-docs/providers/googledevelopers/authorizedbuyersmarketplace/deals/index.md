|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | Immutable. The unique identifier of the deal. Auto-generated by the server when a deal is created. Format: buyers/&#123;accountId&#125;/proposals/&#123;proposalId&#125;/deals/&#123;dealId&#125; |
| `description` | `string` | Output only. Free text description for the deal terms. |

| `programmaticGuaranteedTerms` | `object` | Pricing terms for Programmatic Guaranteed Deals. |
| `dealType` | `string` | Output only. Type of deal. |
| `createTime` | `string` | Output only. The time of the deal creation. |
| `flightStartTime` | `string` | Proposed flight start time of the deal. This will generally be stored in the granularity of one second since deal serving starts at seconds boundary. Any time specified with more granularity (for example, in milliseconds) will be truncated towards the start of time in seconds. |
| `creativeRequirements` | `object` | Message captures data about the creatives in the deal. |
| `updateTime` | `string` | Output only. The time when the deal was last updated. |
| `proposalRevision` | `string` | Output only. The revision number for the proposal and is the same value as proposal.proposal_revision. Each update to deal causes the proposal revision number to auto-increment. The buyer keeps track of the last revision number they know of and pass it in when making an update. If the head revision number on the server has since incremented, then an ABORTED error is returned during the update operation to let the buyer know that a subsequent update was made. |
| `preferredDealTerms` | `object` | Pricing terms for Preferred Deals. |
| `displayName` | `string` | Output only. The name of the deal. Maximum length of 255 unicode characters is allowed. Control characters are not allowed. Buyers cannot update this field. Note: Not to be confused with name, which is a unique identifier of the deal. |
| `targeting` | `object` | Targeting represents different criteria that can be used to target inventory. For example, they can choose to target inventory only if the user is in the US. Multiple types of targeting are always applied as a logical AND, unless noted otherwise. |
| `client` | `string` | Output only. Refers to a Client. Format: `buyers/&#123;buyerAccountId&#125;/clients/&#123;clientAccountid&#125;` |
| `billedBuyer` | `string` | Output only. When the client field is populated, this field refers to the buyer who creates and manages the client buyer and gets billed on behalf of the client buyer; when the buyer field is populated, this field is the same value as buyer. Format : `buyers/&#123;buyerAccountId&#125;` |
| `estimatedGrossSpend` | `object` | Represents an amount of money with its currency type. |
| `privateAuctionTerms` | `object` | Pricing terms for Private Auctions. |
| `flightEndTime` | `string` | Proposed flight end time of the deal. This will generally be stored in a granularity of a second. A value is not necessary for Private Auction deals. |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `buyers_proposals_deals_get` | `SELECT` | `buyersId, dealsId, proposalsId` | Gets a deal given its name. The deal is returned at its head revision. |
| `buyers_proposals_deals_list` | `SELECT` | `buyersId, proposalsId` | Lists all deals in a proposal. To retrieve only the finalized revision deals regardless if a deal is being renegotiated, see the FinalizedDeals resource. |
| `buyers_proposals_deals_batchUpdate` | `EXEC` | `buyersId, proposalsId` | Batch updates multiple deals in the same proposal. |
| `buyers_proposals_deals_patch` | `EXEC` | `buyersId, dealsId, proposalsId` | Updates the given deal at the buyer known revision number. If the server revision has advanced since the passed-in proposal.proposal_revision an ABORTED error message will be returned. The revision number is incremented by the server whenever the proposal or its constituent deals are updated. Note: The revision number is kept at a proposal level. The buyer of the API is expected to keep track of the revision number after the last update operation and send it in as part of the next update request. This way, if there are further changes on the server (for example, seller making new updates), then the server can detect conflicts and reject the proposed changes. |
