## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/&#123;unique_id&#125;`. |
| `error` | `object` | The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). |
| `metadata` | `object` | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| `response` | `object` | The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |
| `done` | `boolean` | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `photoSequence_get` | `SELECT` | `sequenceId` | Gets the metadata of the specified PhotoSequence via the Operation interface. This method returns the following three types of responses: * `Operation.done` = false, if the processing of PhotoSequence is not finished yet. * `Operation.done` = true and `Operation.error` is populated, if there was an error in processing. * `Operation.done` = true and `Operation.response` is poulated, which contains a PhotoSequence message. This method returns the following error codes: * google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED if the requesting user did not create the requested PhotoSequence. * google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the requested PhotoSequence does not exist. |
| `photoSequence_create` | `INSERT` |  | After the client finishes uploading the PhotoSequence with the returned UploadRef, CreatePhotoSequence extracts a sequence of 360 photos from a video or Extensible Device Metadata (XDM, http://www.xdm.org/) to be published to Street View on Google Maps. `CreatePhotoSequence` returns an Operation, with the PhotoSequence Id set in the `Operation.name` field. This method returns the following error codes: * google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT if the request is malformed. * google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the upload reference does not exist. |
| `photoSequence_delete` | `DELETE` | `sequenceId` | Deletes a PhotoSequence and its metadata. This method returns the following error codes: * google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED if the requesting user did not create the requested photo sequence. * google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the photo sequence ID does not exist. * google.rpc.Code.FAILED_PRECONDITION if the photo sequence ID is not yet finished processing. |
| `photoSequence_startUpload` | `EXEC` |  | Creates an upload session to start uploading photo sequence data. The upload URL of the returned UploadRef is used to upload the data for the `photoSequence`. After the upload is complete, the UploadRef is used with CreatePhotoSequence to create the PhotoSequence object entry. |
