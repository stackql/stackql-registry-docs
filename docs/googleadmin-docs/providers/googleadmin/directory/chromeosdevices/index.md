## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `customerId, deviceId` | Retrieves a Chrome OS device's properties. |
| `list` | `SELECT` | `customerId` | Retrieves a paginated list of Chrome OS devices within an account. |

After a device is deprovisioned, it must be wiped before it can be re-enrolled. * Lost or stolen devices should use the disable action. * Re-enabling a disabled device will consume a device license. If you do not have sufficient licenses available when completing the re-enable action, you will receive an error. For more information about deprovisioning and disabling devices, visit the [help center](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3523633). |
