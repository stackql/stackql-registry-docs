## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `Error` | `object` | &lt;p&gt;Contains information about the reason that the operation failed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This data type is used as a response element in the &lt;a&gt;GetOrganizationsAccessReport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a&gt;GetServiceLastAccessedDetails&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a&gt;GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities&lt;/a&gt; operations.&lt;/p&gt; |
| `IsTruncated` | `boolean` | A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the &lt;code&gt;Marker&lt;/code&gt; request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the &lt;code&gt;MaxItems&lt;/code&gt; number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check &lt;code&gt;IsTruncated&lt;/code&gt; after every call to ensure that you receive all your results. |
| `JobCompletionDate` | `string` | &lt;p&gt;The date and time, in &lt;a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601"&gt;ISO 8601 date-time format&lt;/a&gt;, when the generated report job was completed or failed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This field is null if the job is still in progress, as indicated by a job status value of &lt;code&gt;IN_PROGRESS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; |
| `JobCreationDate` | `string` | The date and time, in &lt;a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601"&gt;ISO 8601 date-time format&lt;/a&gt;, when the report job was created. |
| `JobStatus` | `string` | The status of the job. |
| `JobType` | `string` | The type of job. Service jobs return information about when each service was last accessed. Action jobs also include information about when tracked actions within the service were last accessed. |
| `Marker` | `string` | When &lt;code&gt;IsTruncated&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, this element is present and contains the value to use for the &lt;code&gt;Marker&lt;/code&gt; parameter in a subsequent pagination request. |
| `ServicesLastAccessed` | `array` |  A &lt;code&gt;ServiceLastAccessed&lt;/code&gt; object that contains details about the most recent attempt to access the service. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `service_last_accessed_details_Get` | `SELECT` | `JobId, region` | &lt;p&gt;Retrieves a service last accessed report that was created using the &lt;code&gt;GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails&lt;/code&gt; operation. You can use the &lt;code&gt;JobId&lt;/code&gt; parameter in &lt;code&gt;GetServiceLastAccessedDetails&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve the status of your report job. When the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated report. The report includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that the resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) can access.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics"&gt;Evaluating policies&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;IAM User Guide&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;p&gt;For each service that the resource could access using permissions policies, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, the &lt;code&gt;GetServiceLastAccessedDetails&lt;/code&gt; operation returns the reason that it failed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;GetServiceLastAccessedDetails&lt;/code&gt; operation returns a list of services. This list includes the number of entities that have attempted to access the service and the date and time of the last attempt. It also returns the ARN of the following entity, depending on the resource ARN that you used to generate the report:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;User&lt;/b&gt; – Returns the user ARN that you used to generate the report&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Group&lt;/b&gt; – Returns the ARN of the group member (user) that last attempted to access the service&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Role&lt;/b&gt; – Returns the role ARN that you used to generate the report&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Policy&lt;/b&gt; – Returns the ARN of the user or role that last used the policy to attempt to access the service&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you specified &lt;code&gt;ACTION_LEVEL&lt;/code&gt; granularity when you generated the report, this operation returns service and action last accessed data. This includes the most recent access attempt for each tracked action within a service. Otherwise, this operation returns only service data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information about service and action last accessed data, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html"&gt;Reducing permissions using service last accessed data&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;IAM User Guide&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; |
| `service_last_accessed_details_Generate` | `EXEC` | `Arn, region` | &lt;p&gt;Generates a report that includes details about when an IAM resource (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an attempt to access Amazon Web Services services. Recent activity usually appears within four hours. IAM reports activity for at least the last 400 days, or less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period"&gt;Regions where data is tracked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;important&gt; &lt;p&gt;The service last accessed data includes all attempts to access an Amazon Web Services API, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that your account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html"&gt;Logging IAM events with CloudTrail&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;IAM User Guide&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/important&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails&lt;/code&gt; operation returns a &lt;code&gt;JobId&lt;/code&gt;. Use this parameter in the following operations to retrieve the following details from your report: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a&gt;GetServiceLastAccessedDetails&lt;/a&gt; – Use this operation for users, groups, roles, or policies to list every Amazon Web Services service that the resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;JobId&lt;/code&gt; returned by &lt;code&gt;GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail&lt;/code&gt; must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call &lt;code&gt;GetServiceLastAccessedDetail&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a&gt;GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities&lt;/a&gt; – Use this operation for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific Amazon Web Services service. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;To check the status of the &lt;code&gt;GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails&lt;/code&gt; request, use the &lt;code&gt;JobId&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the same operations and test the &lt;code&gt;JobStatus&lt;/code&gt; response parameter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an identity (user, group, or role) to access specific services, use the &lt;a&gt;ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess&lt;/a&gt; operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics"&gt;Evaluating policies&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;IAM User Guide&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information about service and action last accessed data, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html"&gt;Reducing permissions using service last accessed data&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;IAM User Guide&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; |
