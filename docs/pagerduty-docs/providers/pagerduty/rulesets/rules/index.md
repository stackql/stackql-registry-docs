## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | `string` | ID of the Event Rule. |
| `actions` | `object` | When an event matches this rule, the actions that will be taken to change the resulting alert and incident. |
| `catch_all` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the Event Rule is the last Event Rule of the Ruleset that serves as a catch-all. It has limited functionality compared to other rules and always matches. |
| `conditions` | `object` | Conditions evaluated to check if an event matches this Event Rule. Is always empty for the catch_all rule, though. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the Event Rule is disabled and would therefore not be evaluated. |
| `position` | `integer` | Position/index of the Event Rule in the Ruleset.  Starting from position 0 (the first rule), rules are evaluated one-by-one until a matching rule is found. |
| `self` | `string` | the API show URL at which the object is accessible. |
| `time_frame` | `object` | Time-based conditions for limiting when the rule is active. |
| `variables` | `array` | [Early Access] Populate variables from event payloads and use those variables in other event actions. |
