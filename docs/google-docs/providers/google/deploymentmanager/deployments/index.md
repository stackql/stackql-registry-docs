## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | `string` |  |
| `name` | `string` | Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. |
| `description` | `string` | An optional user-provided description of the deployment. |
| `updateTime` | `string` | Output only. Update timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
| `manifest` | `string` | Output only. URL of the manifest representing the last manifest that was successfully deployed. If no manifest has been successfully deployed, this field will be absent. |
| `insertTime` | `string` | Output only. Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
| `operation` | `object` | Represents an Operation resource. Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/&#123;$api_version&#125;/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/&#123;$api_version&#125;/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/&#123;$api_version&#125;/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. |
| `target` | `object` |  |
| `selfLink` | `string` | Output only. Server defined URL for the resource. |
| `labels` | `array` | Map of One Platform labels; provided by the client when the resource is created or updated. Specifically: Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?`. |
| `update` | `object` |  |
| `fingerprint` | `string` | Provides a fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment, such as `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided with `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that only one request happens at a time. The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()` request to a deployment. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `deployment, project` | Gets information about a specific deployment. |
| `list` | `SELECT` | `project` | Lists all deployments for a given project. |
| `insert` | `INSERT` | `project` | Creates a deployment and all of the resources described by the deployment manifest. |
| `delete` | `DELETE` | `deployment, project` | Deletes a deployment and all of the resources in the deployment. |
| `_list` | `EXEC` | `project` | Lists all deployments for a given project. |
| `cancel_preview` | `EXEC` | `deployment, project` | Cancels and removes the preview currently associated with the deployment. |
| `patch` | `EXEC` | `deployment, project` | Patches a deployment and all of the resources described by the deployment manifest. |
| `stop` | `EXEC` | `deployment, project` | Stops an ongoing operation. This does not roll back any work that has already been completed, but prevents any new work from being started. |
| `update` | `EXEC` | `deployment, project` | Updates a deployment and all of the resources described by the deployment manifest. |
