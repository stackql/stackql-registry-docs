## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="id" /> | `string` |  |
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. |
| <CopyableCode code="description" /> | `string` | An optional user-provided description of the deployment. |
| <CopyableCode code="fingerprint" /> | `string` | Provides a fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment, such as `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided with `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that only one request happens at a time. The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()` request to a deployment. |
| <CopyableCode code="insertTime" /> | `string` | Output only. Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
| <CopyableCode code="labels" /> | `array` | Map of One Platform labels; provided by the client when the resource is created or updated. Specifically: Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?`. |
| <CopyableCode code="manifest" /> | `string` | Output only. URL of the manifest representing the last manifest that was successfully deployed. If no manifest has been successfully deployed, this field will be absent. |
| <CopyableCode code="operation" /> | `object` | Represents an Operation resource. Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/&#123;$api_version&#125;/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/&#123;$api_version&#125;/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/&#123;$api_version&#125;/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zoneOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. Note that completed Operation resources have a limited retention period. |
| <CopyableCode code="selfLink" /> | `string` | Output only. Server defined URL for the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="target" /> | `object` |  |
| <CopyableCode code="update" /> | `object` |  |
| <CopyableCode code="updateTime" /> | `string` | Output only. Update timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="deployment, project" /> | Gets information about a specific deployment. |
| <CopyableCode code="list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Lists all deployments for a given project. |
| <CopyableCode code="insert" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Creates a deployment and all of the resources described by the deployment manifest. |
| <CopyableCode code="delete" /> | `DELETE` | <CopyableCode code="deployment, project" /> | Deletes a deployment and all of the resources in the deployment. |
| <CopyableCode code="patch" /> | `UPDATE` | <CopyableCode code="deployment, project" /> | Patches a deployment and all of the resources described by the deployment manifest. |
| <CopyableCode code="update" /> | `UPDATE` | <CopyableCode code="deployment, project" /> | Updates a deployment and all of the resources described by the deployment manifest. |
| <CopyableCode code="_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Lists all deployments for a given project. |
| <CopyableCode code="cancel_preview" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="deployment, project" /> | Cancels and removes the preview currently associated with the deployment. |
| <CopyableCode code="stop" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="deployment, project" /> | Stops an ongoing operation. This does not roll back any work that has already been completed, but prevents any new work from being started. |
