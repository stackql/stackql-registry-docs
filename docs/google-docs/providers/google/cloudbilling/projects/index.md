</tbody></table>

## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | The resource name for the `ProjectBillingInfo`; has the form `projects/{project_id}/billingInfo`. For example, the resource name for the billing information for project `tokyo-rain-123` would be `projects/tokyo-rain-123/billingInfo`. This field is read-only. |
| `billingEnabled` | `boolean` | True if the project is associated with an open billing account, to which usage on the project is charged. False if the project is associated with a closed billing account, or no billing account at all, and therefore cannot use paid services. This field is read-only. |
| `projectId` | `string` | The ID of the project that this `ProjectBillingInfo` represents, such as `tokyo-rain-123`. This is a convenience field so that you don't need to parse the `name` field to obtain a project ID. This field is read-only. |
| `billingAccountName` | `string` | The resource name of the billing account associated with the project, if any. For example, `billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF`. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `billingAccounts_projects_list` | `SELECT` | `billingAccountsId` | Lists the projects associated with a billing account. The current authenticated user must have the `billing.resourceAssociations.list` IAM permission, which is often given to billing account [viewers](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access). |
| `updateBillingInfo` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Sets or updates the billing account associated with a project. You specify the new billing account by setting the `billing_account_name` in the `ProjectBillingInfo` resource to the resource name of a billing account. Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource usage charges. *Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the transaction history of the Google Cloud Console might be billed to the new billing account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing account was assigned to the project. The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both the [project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo ) and the [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access). You can disable billing on the project by setting the `billing_account_name` field to empty. This action disassociates the current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning as expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the previously associated account. The current authenticated user must be either an owner of the project or an owner of the billing account for the project. Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account will have much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish to disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of an *open* billing account. |
