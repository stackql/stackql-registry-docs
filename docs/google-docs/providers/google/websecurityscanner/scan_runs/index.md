## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | Output only. The resource name of the ScanRun. The name follows the format of 'projects/{projectId}/scanConfigs/{scanConfigId}/scanRuns/{scanRunId}'. The ScanRun IDs are generated by the system. |
| <CopyableCode code="endTime" /> | `string` | Output only. The time at which the ScanRun reached termination state - that the ScanRun is either finished or stopped by user. |
| <CopyableCode code="errorTrace" /> | `object` | Output only. Defines an error trace message for a ScanRun. |
| <CopyableCode code="executionState" /> | `string` | Output only. The execution state of the ScanRun. |
| <CopyableCode code="hasVulnerabilities" /> | `boolean` | Output only. Whether the scan run has found any vulnerabilities. |
| <CopyableCode code="progressPercent" /> | `integer` | Output only. The percentage of total completion ranging from 0 to 100. If the scan is in queue, the value is 0. If the scan is running, the value ranges from 0 to 100. If the scan is finished, the value is 100. |
| <CopyableCode code="resultState" /> | `string` | Output only. The result state of the ScanRun. This field is only available after the execution state reaches "FINISHED". |
| <CopyableCode code="startTime" /> | `string` | Output only. The time at which the ScanRun started. |
| <CopyableCode code="urlsCrawledCount" /> | `string` | Output only. The number of URLs crawled during this ScanRun. If the scan is in progress, the value represents the number of URLs crawled up to now. |
| <CopyableCode code="urlsTestedCount" /> | `string` | Output only. The number of URLs tested during this ScanRun. If the scan is in progress, the value represents the number of URLs tested up to now. The number of URLs tested is usually larger than the number URLS crawled because typically a crawled URL is tested with multiple test payloads. |
| <CopyableCode code="warningTraces" /> | `array` | Output only. A list of warnings, if such are encountered during this scan run. |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId, scanConfigsId, scanRunsId" /> | Gets a ScanRun. |
| <CopyableCode code="list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId, scanConfigsId" /> | Lists ScanRuns under a given ScanConfig, in descending order of ScanRun stop time. |
| <CopyableCode code="stop" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId, scanConfigsId, scanRunsId" /> | Stops a ScanRun. The stopped ScanRun is returned. |

## `SELECT` examples

Lists ScanRuns under a given ScanConfig, in descending order of ScanRun stop time.
