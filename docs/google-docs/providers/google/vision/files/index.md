| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `annotate` | `EXEC` |  | Service that performs image detection and annotation for a batch of files. Now only "application/pdf", "image/tiff" and "image/gif" are supported. This service will extract at most 5 (customers can specify which 5 in AnnotateFileRequest.pages) frames (gif) or pages (pdf or tiff) from each file provided and perform detection and annotation for each image extracted. |
| `asyncBatchAnnotate` | `EXEC` |  | Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of generic files, such as PDF files, which may contain multiple pages and multiple images per page. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata). `Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateFilesResponse` (results). |
| `projects_files_annotate` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Service that performs image detection and annotation for a batch of files. Now only "application/pdf", "image/tiff" and "image/gif" are supported. This service will extract at most 5 (customers can specify which 5 in AnnotateFileRequest.pages) frames (gif) or pages (pdf or tiff) from each file provided and perform detection and annotation for each image extracted. |
| `projects_files_asyncBatchAnnotate` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of generic files, such as PDF files, which may contain multiple pages and multiple images per page. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata). `Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateFilesResponse` (results). |
| `projects_locations_files_annotate` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Service that performs image detection and annotation for a batch of files. Now only "application/pdf", "image/tiff" and "image/gif" are supported. This service will extract at most 5 (customers can specify which 5 in AnnotateFileRequest.pages) frames (gif) or pages (pdf or tiff) from each file provided and perform detection and annotation for each image extracted. |
