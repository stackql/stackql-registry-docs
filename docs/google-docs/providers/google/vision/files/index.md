## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="files_annotate" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="" /> | Service that performs image detection and annotation for a batch of files. Now only "application/pdf", "image/tiff" and "image/gif" are supported. This service will extract at most 5 (customers can specify which 5 in AnnotateFileRequest.pages) frames (gif) or pages (pdf or tiff) from each file provided and perform detection and annotation for each image extracted. |
| <CopyableCode code="files_async_batch_annotate" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="" /> | Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of generic files, such as PDF files, which may contain multiple pages and multiple images per page. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata). `Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateFilesResponse` (results). |
