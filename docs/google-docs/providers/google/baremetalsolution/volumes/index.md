## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | `string` | An identifier for the `Volume`, generated by the backend. |
| `name` | `string` | Output only. The resource name of this `Volume`. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. Format: `projects/&#123;project&#125;/locations/&#123;location&#125;/volumes/&#123;volume&#125;` |
| `emergencySizeGib` | `string` | Additional emergency size that was requested for this Volume, in GiB. current_size_gib includes this value. |
| `autoGrownSizeGib` | `string` | The size, in GiB, that this storage volume has expanded as a result of an auto grow policy. In the absence of auto-grow, the value is 0. |
| `attached` | `boolean` | Output only. Is the Volume attached at at least one instance. This field is a lightweight counterpart of `instances` field. It is filled in List responses as well. |
| `protocol` | `string` | Output only. Storage protocol for the Volume. |
| `remainingSpaceGib` | `string` | The space remaining in the storage volume for new LUNs, in GiB, excluding space reserved for snapshots. |
| `maxSizeGib` | `string` | Maximum size volume can be expanded to in case of evergency, in GiB. |
| `currentSizeGib` | `string` | The current size of this storage volume, in GiB, including space reserved for snapshots. This size might be different than the requested size if the storage volume has been configured with auto grow or auto shrink. |
| `originallyRequestedSizeGib` | `string` | Originally requested size, in GiB. |
| `expireTime` | `string` | Output only. Time after which volume will be fully deleted. It is filled only for volumes in COOLOFF state. |
| `snapshotSchedulePolicy` | `string` | The name of the snapshot schedule policy in use for this volume, if any. |
| `instances` | `array` | Output only. Instances this Volume is attached to. This field is set only in Get requests. |
| `labels` | `object` | Labels as key value pairs. |
| `bootVolume` | `boolean` | Output only. Whether this volume is a boot volume. A boot volume is one which contains a boot LUN. |
| `pod` | `string` | Immutable. Pod name. |
| `state` | `string` | The state of this storage volume. |
| `storageAggregatePool` | `string` | Input only. Name of the storage aggregate pool to allocate the volume in. Can be used only for VOLUME_PERFORMANCE_TIER_ASSIGNED volumes. |
| `snapshotReservationDetail` | `object` | Details about snapshot space reservation and usage on the storage volume. |
| `requestedSizeGib` | `string` | The requested size of this storage volume, in GiB. |
| `performanceTier` | `string` | Immutable. Performance tier of the Volume. Default is SHARED. |
| `workloadProfile` | `string` | The workload profile for the volume. |
| `snapshotEnabled` | `boolean` | Whether snapshots are enabled. |
| `notes` | `string` | Input only. User-specified notes for new Volume. Used to provision Volumes that require manual intervention. |

| `get` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, projectsId, volumesId` | Get details of a single storage volume. |
| `list` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, projectsId` | List storage volumes in a given project and location. |
| `_list` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId` | List storage volumes in a given project and location. |
| `evict` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, volumesId` | Skips volume's cooloff and deletes it now. Volume must be in cooloff state. |
| `patch` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, volumesId` | Update details of a single storage volume. |
| `rename` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, volumesId` | RenameVolume sets a new name for a volume. Use with caution, previous names become immediately invalidated. |
| `resize` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, volumesId` | Emergency Volume resize. |
