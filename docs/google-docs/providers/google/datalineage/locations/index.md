## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="batch_search_link_processes" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId" /> | Retrieve information about LineageProcesses associated with specific links. LineageProcesses are transformation pipelines that result in data flowing from **source** to **target** assets. Links between assets represent this operation. If you have specific link names, you can use this method to verify which LineageProcesses contribute to creating those links. See the SearchLinks method for more information on how to retrieve link name. You can retrieve the LineageProcess information in every project where you have the `datalineage.events.get` permission. The project provided in the URL is used for Billing and Quota. |
| <CopyableCode code="process_open_lineage_run_event" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId" /> | Creates new lineage events together with their parents: process and run. Updates the process and run if they already exist. Mapped from Open Lineage specification: https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/blob/main/spec/OpenLineage.json. |
| <CopyableCode code="search_links" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId" /> | Retrieve a list of links connected to a specific asset. Links represent the data flow between **source** (upstream) and **target** (downstream) assets in transformation pipelines. Links are stored in the same project as the Lineage Events that create them. You can retrieve links in every project where you have the `datalineage.events.get` permission. The project provided in the URL is used for Billing and Quota. |
