## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | Optionally caller-specified in CreateTask. The task name. The task name must have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the task's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters. * `TASK_ID` can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 500 characters. |
| <CopyableCode code="appEngineHttpRequest" /> | `object` | App Engine HTTP request. The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to an App Engine app when the task is dispatched. Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and how routing is affected by [dispatch files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref). Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this value is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =` host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue. |
| <CopyableCode code="createTime" /> | `string` | Output only. The time that the task was created. `create_time` will be truncated to the nearest second. |
| <CopyableCode code="dispatchCount" /> | `integer` | Output only. The number of attempts dispatched. This count includes attempts which have been dispatched but haven't received a response. |
| <CopyableCode code="dispatchDeadline" /> | `string` | The deadline for requests sent to the worker. If the worker does not respond by this deadline then the request is cancelled and the attempt is marked as a `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` failure. Cloud Tasks will retry the task according to the RetryConfig. Note that when the request is cancelled, Cloud Tasks will stop listening for the response, but whether the worker stops processing depends on the worker. For example, if the worker is stuck, it may not react to cancelled requests. The default and maximum values depend on the type of request: * For HTTP tasks, the default is 10 minutes. The deadline must be in the interval [15 seconds, 30 minutes]. * For App Engine tasks, 0 indicates that the request has the default deadline. The default deadline depends on the [scaling type](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed#instance_scaling) of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps with automatic scaling, 24 hours for standard apps with manual and basic scaling, and 60 minutes for flex apps. If the request deadline is set, it must be in the interval [15 seconds, 24 hours 15 seconds]. Regardless of the task's `dispatch_deadline`, the app handler will not run for longer than than the service's timeout. We recommend setting the `dispatch_deadline` to at most a few seconds more than the app handler's timeout. For more information see [Timeouts](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#timeouts). The value must be given as a string that indicates the length of time (in seconds) followed by `s` (for "seconds"). For more information on the format, see the documentation for [Duration](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#duration). `dispatch_deadline` will be truncated to the nearest millisecond. The deadline is an approximate deadline. |
| <CopyableCode code="firstAttempt" /> | `object` | The status of a task attempt. |
| <CopyableCode code="httpRequest" /> | `object` | HTTP request. The task will be pushed to the worker as an HTTP request. If the worker or the redirected worker acknowledges the task by returning a successful HTTP response code ([`200` - `299`]), the task will be removed from the queue. If any other HTTP response code is returned or no response is received, the task will be retried according to the following: * User-specified throttling: retry configuration, rate limits, and the queue's state. * System throttling: To prevent the worker from overloading, Cloud Tasks may temporarily reduce the queue's effective rate. User-specified settings will not be changed. System throttling happens because: * Cloud Tasks backs off on all errors. Normally the backoff specified in rate limits will be used. But if the worker returns `429` (Too Many Requests), `503` (Service Unavailable), or the rate of errors is high, Cloud Tasks will use a higher backoff rate. The retry specified in the `Retry-After` HTTP response header is considered. * To prevent traffic spikes and to smooth sudden increases in traffic, dispatches ramp up slowly when the queue is newly created or idle and if large numbers of tasks suddenly become available to dispatch (due to spikes in create task rates, the queue being unpaused, or many tasks that are scheduled at the same time). |
| <CopyableCode code="lastAttempt" /> | `object` | The status of a task attempt. |
| <CopyableCode code="responseCount" /> | `integer` | Output only. The number of attempts which have received a response. |
| <CopyableCode code="scheduleTime" /> | `string` | The time when the task is scheduled to be attempted or retried. `schedule_time` will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. |
| <CopyableCode code="view" /> | `string` | Output only. The view specifies which subset of the Task has been returned. |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId, queuesId, tasksId" /> | Gets a task. |
| <CopyableCode code="list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId, queuesId" /> | Lists the tasks in a queue. By default, only the BASIC view is retrieved due to performance considerations; response_view controls the subset of information which is returned. The tasks may be returned in any order. The ordering may change at any time. |
| <CopyableCode code="create" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId, queuesId" /> | Creates a task and adds it to a queue. Tasks cannot be updated after creation; there is no UpdateTask command. * The maximum task size is 100KB. |
| <CopyableCode code="delete" /> | `DELETE` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId, queuesId, tasksId" /> | Deletes a task. A task can be deleted if it is scheduled or dispatched. A task cannot be deleted if it has executed successfully or permanently failed. |
| <CopyableCode code="buffer" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId, queuesId, taskId" /> | Creates and buffers a new task without the need to explicitly define a Task message. The queue must have HTTP target. To create the task with a custom ID, use the following format and set TASK_ID to your desired ID: projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID:buffer To create the task with an automatically generated ID, use the following format: projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks:buffer. |
| <CopyableCode code="run" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId, queuesId, tasksId" /> | Forces a task to run now. When this method is called, Cloud Tasks will dispatch the task, even if the task is already running, the queue has reached its RateLimits or is PAUSED. This command is meant to be used for manual debugging. For example, RunTask can be used to retry a failed task after a fix has been made or to manually force a task to be dispatched now. The dispatched task is returned. That is, the task that is returned contains the status after the task is dispatched but before the task is received by its target. If Cloud Tasks receives a successful response from the task's target, then the task will be deleted; otherwise the task's schedule_time will be reset to the time that RunTask was called plus the retry delay specified in the queue's RetryConfig. RunTask returns NOT_FOUND when it is called on a task that has already succeeded or permanently failed. |

## `SELECT` examples

Lists the tasks in a queue. By default, only the BASIC view is retrieved due to performance considerations; response_view controls the subset of information which is returned. The tasks may be returned in any order. The ordering may change at any time.

```sql
SELECT
name,
appEngineHttpRequest,
createTime,
dispatchCount,
dispatchDeadline,
firstAttempt,
httpRequest,
lastAttempt,
responseCount,
scheduleTime,
view
FROM google.cloudtasks.tasks
WHERE locationsId = '{{ locationsId }}'
AND projectsId = '{{ projectsId }}'
AND queuesId = '{{ queuesId }}'; 
```

## `INSERT` example

Use the following StackQL query and manifest file to create a new <code>tasks</code> resource.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="all"
    values={[
        { label: 'All Properties', value: 'all', },
        { label: 'Manifest', value: 'manifest', },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="all">

```sql
/*+ create */
INSERT INTO google.cloudtasks.tasks (
locationsId,
projectsId,
queuesId,
task,
responseView
)
SELECT 
'{{ locationsId }}',
'{{ projectsId }}',
'{{ queuesId }}',
'{{ task }}',
'{{ responseView }}'
;
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manifest">

```yaml
- name: your_resource_model_name
  props:
    - name: task
      value: '{{ task }}'
    - name: responseView
      value: '{{ responseView }}'

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## `DELETE` example

Deletes the specified <code>tasks</code> resource.

```sql
/*+ delete */
DELETE FROM google.cloudtasks.tasks
WHERE locationsId = '{{ locationsId }}'
AND projectsId = '{{ projectsId }}'
AND queuesId = '{{ queuesId }}'
AND tasksId = '{{ tasksId }}';
```
