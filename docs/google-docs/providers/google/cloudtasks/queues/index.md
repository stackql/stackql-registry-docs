</tbody></table>

## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue, after which it becomes output only. The queue name. The queue name must have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters. |
| `retryConfig` | `object` | Retry config. These settings determine when a failed task attempt is retried. |
| `stackdriverLoggingConfig` | `object` | Configuration options for writing logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/). |
| `state` | `string` | Output only. The state of the queue. `state` can only be changed by calling PauseQueue, ResumeQueue, or uploading [queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref). UpdateQueue cannot be used to change `state`. |
| `appEngineRoutingOverride` | `object` | App Engine Routing. Defines routing characteristics specific to App Engine - service, version, and instance. For more information about services, versions, and instances see [An Overview of App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine), [Microservices Architecture on Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/microservices-on-app-engine), [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed), and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed). Using AppEngineRouting requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` |
| `purgeTime` | `string` | Output only. The last time this queue was purged. All tasks that were created before this time were purged. A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue). Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged. |
| `rateLimits` | `object` | Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_queues_get` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, projectsId, queuesId` | Gets a queue. |
| `projects_locations_queues_list` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Lists queues. Queues are returned in lexicographical order. |
| `projects_locations_queues_create` | `INSERT` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Creates a queue. Queues created with this method allow tasks to live for a maximum of 31 days. After a task is 31 days old, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. WARNING: Using this method may have unintended side effects if you are using an App Engine `queue.yaml` or `queue.xml` file to manage your queues. Read [Overview of Queue Management and queue.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/queue-yaml) before using this method. |
| `projects_locations_queues_delete` | `DELETE` | `locationsId, projectsId, queuesId` | Deletes a queue. This command will delete the queue even if it has tasks in it. Note: If you delete a queue, a queue with the same name can't be created for 7 days. WARNING: Using this method may have unintended side effects if you are using an App Engine `queue.yaml` or `queue.xml` file to manage your queues. Read [Overview of Queue Management and queue.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/queue-yaml) before using this method. |
| `projects_locations_queues_patch` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, queuesId` | Updates a queue. This method creates the queue if it does not exist and updates the queue if it does exist. Queues created with this method allow tasks to live for a maximum of 31 days. After a task is 31 days old, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. WARNING: Using this method may have unintended side effects if you are using an App Engine `queue.yaml` or `queue.xml` file to manage your queues. Read [Overview of Queue Management and queue.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/queue-yaml) before using this method. |
| `projects_locations_queues_pause` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, queuesId` | Pauses the queue. If a queue is paused then the system will stop dispatching tasks until the queue is resumed via ResumeQueue. Tasks can still be added when the queue is paused. A queue is paused if its state is PAUSED. |
| `projects_locations_queues_purge` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, queuesId` | Purges a queue by deleting all of its tasks. All tasks created before this method is called are permanently deleted. Purge operations can take up to one minute to take effect. Tasks might be dispatched before the purge takes effect. A purge is irreversible. |
| `projects_locations_queues_resume` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, queuesId` | Resume a queue. This method resumes a queue after it has been PAUSED or DISABLED. The state of a queue is stored in the queue's state; after calling this method it will be set to RUNNING. WARNING: Resuming many high-QPS queues at the same time can lead to target overloading. If you are resuming high-QPS queues, follow the 500/50/5 pattern described in [Managing Cloud Tasks Scaling Risks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/manage-cloud-task-scaling). |
