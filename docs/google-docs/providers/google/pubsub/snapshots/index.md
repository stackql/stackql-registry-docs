## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | The name of the snapshot. |
| `labels` | `object` | See [Creating and managing labels] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels). |
| `topic` | `string` | The name of the topic from which this snapshot is retaining messages. |
| `expireTime` | `string` | The snapshot is guaranteed to exist up until this time. A newly-created snapshot expires no later than 7 days from the time of its creation. Its exact lifetime is determined at creation by the existing backlog in the source subscription. Specifically, the lifetime of the snapshot is `7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)`. For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked message is 3 days old. If a snapshot is created from this subscription, the snapshot -- which will always capture this 3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot exists -- will expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create a snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after creation. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_snapshots_get` | `SELECT` | `projectsId, snapshotsId` | Gets the configuration details of a snapshot. Snapshots are used in [Seek](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. |
| `projects_snapshots_list` | `SELECT` | `projectsId` | Lists the existing snapshots. Snapshots are used in [Seek]( https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. |
| `projects_topics_snapshots_list` | `SELECT` | `projectsId, topicsId` | Lists the names of the snapshots on this topic. Snapshots are used in [Seek](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. |
| `projects_snapshots_create` | `INSERT` | `projectsId, snapshotsId` | Creates a snapshot from the requested subscription. Snapshots are used in [Seek](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. If the snapshot already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`. If the requested subscription doesn't exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`. If the backlog in the subscription is too old -- and the resulting snapshot would expire in less than 1 hour -- then `FAILED_PRECONDITION` is returned. See also the `Snapshot.expire_time` field. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this snapshot on the same project as the subscription, conforming to the [resource name format] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The generated name is populated in the returned Snapshot object. Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request. |
| `projects_snapshots_delete` | `DELETE` | `projectsId, snapshotsId` | Removes an existing snapshot. Snapshots are used in [Seek] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. When the snapshot is deleted, all messages retained in the snapshot are immediately dropped. After a snapshot is deleted, a new one may be created with the same name, but the new one has no association with the old snapshot or its subscription, unless the same subscription is specified. |
| `projects_snapshots_patch` | `EXEC` | `projectsId, snapshotsId` | Updates an existing snapshot. Snapshots are used in [Seek](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. |
