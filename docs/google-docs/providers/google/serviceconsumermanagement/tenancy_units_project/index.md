## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `services_tenancyUnits_addProject` | `INSERT` | `servicesId, servicesId1, servicesId2, tenancyUnitsId` | Add a new tenant project to the tenancy unit. There can be a maximum of 1024 tenant projects in a tenancy unit. If there are previously failed `AddTenantProject` calls, you might need to call `RemoveTenantProject` first to resolve them before you can make another call to `AddTenantProject` with the same tag. Operation. |
| `services_tenancyUnits_deleteProject` | `DELETE` | `servicesId, servicesId1, servicesId2, tenancyUnitsId` | Deletes the specified project resource identified by a tenant resource tag. The mothod removes a project lien with a 'TenantManager' origin if that was added. It will then attempt to delete the project. If that operation fails, this method also fails. After the project has been deleted, the tenant resource state is set to DELETED. To permanently remove resource metadata, call the `RemoveTenantProject` method. New resources with the same tag can't be added if there are existing resources in a DELETED state. Operation. |
| `services_tenancyUnits_removeProject` | `EXEC` | `servicesId, servicesId1, servicesId2, tenancyUnitsId` | Removes the specified project resource identified by a tenant resource tag. The method removes the project lien with 'TenantManager' origin if that was added. It then attempts to delete the project. If that operation fails, this method also fails. Calls to remove already removed or non-existent tenant project succeed. After the project has been deleted, or if was already in a DELETED state, resource metadata is permanently removed from the tenancy unit. Operation. |
