## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | Output only. Auto-generated primary key. Format: projects/&#123;project&#125;/locations/&#123;location&#125;/products/&#123;product&#125;/integrationtemplates/&#123;integrationtemplate&#125;/versions/&#123;version&#125; |
| <CopyableCode code="description" /> | `string` | Optional. The templateversion description. Permitted format is alphanumeric with underscores and no spaces. |
| <CopyableCode code="createTime" /> | `string` | Output only. Auto-generated. |
| <CopyableCode code="databasePersistencePolicy" /> | `string` | Optional. Flag to disable database persistence for execution data, including event execution info, execution export info, execution metadata index and execution param index. |
| <CopyableCode code="errorCatcherConfigs" /> | `array` | Optional. Error Catch Task configuration for the IntegrationTemplateVersion. It's optional. |
| <CopyableCode code="lastModifierEmail" /> | `string` | Optional. The last modifier's email address. Generated based on the End User Credentials/LOAS role of the user making the call. |
| <CopyableCode code="parentIntegrationVersionId" /> | `string` | Optional. ID of the IntegrationVersion that was used to create this IntegrationTemplateVersion |
| <CopyableCode code="snapshotNumber" /> | `string` | Output only. An increasing sequence that is set when a new snapshot is created. |
| <CopyableCode code="status" /> | `string` | Optional. Generated by eventbus. User should not set it as an input. |
| <CopyableCode code="taskConfigs" /> | `array` | Optional. Task configuration for the IntegrationTemplateVersion. It's optional, but the IntegrationTemplateVersion doesn't do anything without task_configs. |
| <CopyableCode code="teardown" /> | `object` |  |
| <CopyableCode code="templateParameters" /> | `object` | LINT.IfChange This is the frontend version of WorkflowParameters. It's exactly like the backend version except that instead of flattening protobuf parameters and treating every field and subfield of a protobuf parameter as a separate parameter, the fields/subfields of a protobuf parameter will be nested as "children" (see 'children' field below) parameters of the parent parameter. Please refer to enterprise/crm/eventbus/proto/workflow_parameters.proto for more information about WorkflowParameters. |
| <CopyableCode code="triggerConfigs" /> | `array` | Optional. Trigger configurations. |
| <CopyableCode code="updateTime" /> | `string` | Output only. Auto-generated. |
| <CopyableCode code="userLabel" /> | `string` | Optional. A user-defined label that annotates an integration version. Typically, this is only set when the integration version is created. |

| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_products_integrationtemplates_versions_list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="integrationtemplatesId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId" /> | Returns the list of all IntegrationTemplateVersions in the specified project. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_integrations_versions_create" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Create a integration with a draft version in the specified project. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_products_integrations_versions_create" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId" /> | Create a integration with a draft version in the specified project. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_products_integrationtemplates_versions_create" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="integrationtemplatesId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId" /> | Creates an IntegrationTemplateVersion. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_integrations_versions_delete" /> | `DELETE` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId, versionsId" /> | Soft-deletes the integration. Changes the status of the integration to ARCHIVED. If the integration being ARCHIVED is tagged as "HEAD", the tag is removed from this snapshot and set to the previous non-ARCHIVED snapshot. The PUBLISH_REQUESTED, DUE_FOR_DELETION tags are removed too. This RPC throws an exception if the version being deleted is DRAFT, and if the `locked_by` user is not the same as the user performing the Delete. Audit fields updated include last_modified_timestamp, last_modified_by. Any existing lock is released when Deleting a integration. Currently, there is no undelete mechanism. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_products_integrations_versions_delete" /> | `DELETE` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId, versionsId" /> | Soft-deletes the integration.

The PUBLISH_REQUESTED, DUE_FOR_DELETION tags are removed too. This RPC throws an exception if the version being deleted is DRAFT, and if the `locked_by` user is not the same as the user performing the Delete.

| <CopyableCode code="_projects_locations_integrations_versions_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Returns the list of all integration versions in the specified project. |
| <CopyableCode code="_projects_locations_products_integrations_versions_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId" /> | Returns the list of all integration versions in the specified project. |
| <CopyableCode code="_projects_locations_products_integrationtemplates_versions_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationtemplatesId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId" /> | Returns the list of all IntegrationTemplateVersions in the specified project. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_integrations_versions_download" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId, versionsId" /> | Downloads an integration. Retrieves the `IntegrationVersion` for a given `integration_id` and returns the response as a string. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_integrations_versions_patch" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId, versionsId" /> | Update a integration with a draft version in the specified project. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_integrations_versions_publish" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId, versionsId" /> | This RPC throws an exception if the integration is in ARCHIVED or ACTIVE state. This RPC throws an exception if the version being published is DRAFT, and if the `locked_by` user is not the same as the user performing the Publish. Audit fields updated include last_published_timestamp, last_published_by, last_modified_timestamp, last_modified_by. Any existing lock is on this integration is released. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_integrations_versions_takeover_edit_lock" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId, versionsId" /> | Clears the `locked_by` and `locked_at_timestamp`in the DRAFT version of this integration. It then performs the same action as the CreateDraftIntegrationVersion (i.e., copies the DRAFT version of the integration as a SNAPSHOT and then creates a new DRAFT version with the `locked_by` set to the `user_taking_over` and the `locked_at_timestamp` set to the current timestamp). Both the `locked_by` and `user_taking_over` are notified via email about the takeover. This RPC throws an exception if the integration is not in DRAFT status or if the `locked_by` and `locked_at_timestamp` fields are not set.The TakeoverEdit lock is treated the same as an edit of the integration, and hence shares ACLs with edit. Audit fields updated include last_modified_timestamp, last_modified_by. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_integrations_versions_unpublish" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId, versionsId" /> | Sets the status of the ACTIVE integration to SNAPSHOT with a new tag "PREVIOUSLY_PUBLISHED" after validating it. The "HEAD" and "PUBLISH_REQUESTED" tags do not change. This RPC throws an exception if the version being snapshot is not ACTIVE. Audit fields added include action, action_by, action_timestamp. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_integrations_versions_upload" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Uploads an integration. The content can be a previously downloaded integration. Performs the same function as CreateDraftIntegrationVersion, but accepts input in a string format, which holds the complete representation of the IntegrationVersion content. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_products_integrations_versions_download" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="integrationsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId, versionsId" /> | Downloads an integration.

This RPC throws an exception if the version being published is DRAFT, and if the `locked_by` user is not the same as the user performing the Publish.
