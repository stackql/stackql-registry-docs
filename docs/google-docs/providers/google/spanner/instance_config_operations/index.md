Creates, updates, deletes or gets an <code>instance_config_operation</code> resource or lists <code>instance_config_operations</code> in a region

## Overview

<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td>Resource</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><CopyableCode code="google.spanner.instance_config_operations" /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| <CopyableCode code="done" /> | `boolean` | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| <CopyableCode code="error" /> | `object` | The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). |
| <CopyableCode code="metadata" /> | `object` | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| <CopyableCode code="response" /> | `object` | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="projects_instance_config_operations_list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId" /> | Lists the user-managed instance configuration long-running operations in the given project. An instance configuration operation has a name of the form `projects//instanceConfigs//operations/`. The long-running operation metadata field type `metadata.type_url` describes the type of the metadata. Operations returned include those that have completed/failed/canceled within the last 7 days, and pending operations. Operations returned are ordered by `operation.metadata.value.start_time` in descending order starting from the most recently started operation. |

## `SELECT` examples

Lists the user-managed instance configuration long-running operations in the given project. An instance configuration operation has a name of the form `projects//instanceConfigs//operations/`. The long-running operation metadata field type `metadata.type_url` describes the type of the metadata. Operations returned include those that have completed/failed/canceled within the last 7 days, and pending operations. Operations returned are ordered by `operation.metadata.value.start_time` in descending order starting from the most recently started operation.

```sql
SELECT
name,
