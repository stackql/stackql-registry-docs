## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | Required. A unique identifier for the instance, which cannot be changed after the instance is created. Values are of the form `projects//instances/a-z*[a-z0-9]`. The final segment of the name must be between 2 and 64 characters in length. |
| `state` | `string` | Output only. The current instance state. For CreateInstance, the state must be either omitted or set to `CREATING`. For UpdateInstance, the state must be either omitted or set to `READY`. |
| `displayName` | `string` | Required. The descriptive name for this instance as it appears in UIs. Must be unique per project and between 4 and 30 characters in length. |
| `config` | `string` | Required. The name of the instance's configuration. Values are of the form `projects//instanceConfigs/`. See also InstanceConfig and ListInstanceConfigs. |
| `createTime` | `string` | Output only. The time at which the instance was created. |
| `labels` | `object` | Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing, etc.). * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`. * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels. If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional characters may be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon specific characters being disallowed. For example, representing labels as the string: name + "_" + value would prove problematic if we were to allow "_" in a future release. |
| `updateTime` | `string` | Output only. The time at which the instance was most recently updated. |
| `endpointUris` | `array` | Deprecated. This field is not populated. |
| `processingUnits` | `integer` | The number of processing units allocated to this instance. At most one of processing_units or node_count should be present in the message. This may be zero in API responses for instances that are not yet in state `READY`. See [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/compute-capacity) for more information about nodes and processing units. |
| `nodeCount` | `integer` | The number of nodes allocated to this instance. At most one of either node_count or processing_units should be present in the message. This may be zero in API responses for instances that are not yet in state `READY`. See [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/compute-capacity) for more information about nodes and processing units. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_instances_get` | `SELECT` | `instancesId, projectsId` | Gets information about a particular instance. |
| `projects_instances_list` | `SELECT` | `projectsId` | Lists all instances in the given project. |
| `projects_instances_create` | `INSERT` | `projectsId` | Creates an instance and begins preparing it to begin serving. The returned long-running operation can be used to track the progress of preparing the new instance. The instance name is assigned by the caller. If the named instance already exists, `CreateInstance` returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`. Immediately upon completion of this request: * The instance is readable via the API, with all requested attributes but no allocated resources. Its state is `CREATING`. Until completion of the returned operation: * Cancelling the operation renders the instance immediately unreadable via the API. * The instance can be deleted. * All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected. Upon completion of the returned operation: * Billing for all successfully-allocated resources begins (some types may have lower than the requested levels). * Databases can be created in the instance. * The instance's allocated resource levels are readable via the API. * The instance's state becomes `READY`. The returned long-running operation will have a name of the format `/operations/` and can be used to track creation of the instance. The metadata field type is CreateInstanceMetadata. The response field type is Instance, if successful. |
| `projects_instances_delete` | `DELETE` | `instancesId, projectsId` | Deletes an instance. Immediately upon completion of the request: * Billing ceases for all of the instance's reserved resources. Soon afterward: * The instance and *all of its databases* immediately and irrevocably disappear from the API. All data in the databases is permanently deleted. |
| `projects_instances_patch` | `EXEC` | `instancesId, projectsId` | Updates an instance, and begins allocating or releasing resources as requested. The returned long-running operation can be used to track the progress of updating the instance. If the named instance does not exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`. Immediately upon completion of this request: * For resource types for which a decrease in the instance's allocation has been requested, billing is based on the newly-requested level. Until completion of the returned operation: * Cancelling the operation sets its metadata's cancel_time, and begins restoring resources to their pre-request values. The operation is guaranteed to succeed at undoing all resource changes, after which point it terminates with a `CANCELLED` status. * All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected. * Reading the instance via the API continues to give the pre-request resource levels. Upon completion of the returned operation: * Billing begins for all successfully-allocated resources (some types may have lower than the requested levels). * All newly-reserved resources are available for serving the instance's tables. * The instance's new resource levels are readable via the API. The returned long-running operation will have a name of the format `/operations/` and can be used to track the instance modification. The metadata field type is UpdateInstanceMetadata. The response field type is Instance, if successful. Authorization requires `spanner.instances.update` permission on the resource name. |
