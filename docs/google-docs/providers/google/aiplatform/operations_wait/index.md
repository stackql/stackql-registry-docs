Creates, updates, deletes, gets or lists a <code>operations_wait</code> resource.

## Overview
<table><tbody>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><code>operations_wait</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td>Resource</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><CopyableCode code="google.aiplatform.operations_wait" /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`. |
| <CopyableCode code="done" /> | `boolean` | If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. |
| <CopyableCode code="error" /> | `object` | The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). |
| <CopyableCode code="metadata" /> | `object` | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
| <CopyableCode code="response" /> | `object` | The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`. |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="list_wait" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="featureGroupsId, featuresId, locationsId, operationsId, projectsId" /> | Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. |

## `SELECT` examples

Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

```sql
SELECT
name,
done,
error,
metadata,
response
FROM google.aiplatform.operations_wait
WHERE featureGroupsId = '{{ featureGroupsId }}'
AND featuresId = '{{ featuresId }}'
AND locationsId = '{{ locationsId }}'
AND operationsId = '{{ operationsId }}'
AND projectsId = '{{ projectsId }}';
```
