## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | Output only. Resource name of the DataLabelingJob. |
| `datasets` | `array` | Required. Dataset resource names. Right now we only support labeling from a single Dataset. Format: `projects/&#123;project&#125;/locations/&#123;location&#125;/datasets/&#123;dataset&#125;` |
| `displayName` | `string` | Required. The user-defined name of the DataLabelingJob. The name can be up to 128 characters long and can consist of any UTF-8 characters. Display name of a DataLabelingJob. |
| `specialistPools` | `array` | The SpecialistPools' resource names associated with this job. |
| `createTime` | `string` | Output only. Timestamp when this DataLabelingJob was created. |
| `annotationLabels` | `object` | Labels to assign to annotations generated by this DataLabelingJob. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable. |
| `inputs` | `any` | Required. Input config parameters for the DataLabelingJob. |
| `instructionUri` | `string` | Required. The Google Cloud Storage location of the instruction pdf. This pdf is shared with labelers, and provides detailed description on how to label DataItems in Datasets. |
| `labelingProgress` | `integer` | Output only. Current labeling job progress percentage scaled in interval [0, 100], indicating the percentage of DataItems that has been finished. |
| `state` | `string` | Output only. The detailed state of the job. |
| `labelerCount` | `integer` | Required. Number of labelers to work on each DataItem. |
| `labels` | `object` | The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your DataLabelingJobs. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable. Following system labels exist for each DataLabelingJob: * "aiplatform.googleapis.com/schema": output only, its value is the inputs_schema's title. |
| `inputsSchemaUri` | `string` | Required. Points to a YAML file stored on Google Cloud Storage describing the config for a specific type of DataLabelingJob. The schema files that can be used here are found in the https://storage.googleapis.com/google-cloud-aiplatform bucket in the /schema/datalabelingjob/inputs/ folder. |
| `updateTime` | `string` | Output only. Timestamp when this DataLabelingJob was updated most recently. |
| `activeLearningConfig` | `object` | Parameters that configure the active learning pipeline. Active learning will label the data incrementally by several iterations. For every iteration, it will select a batch of data based on the sampling strategy. |
| `currentSpend` | `object` | Represents an amount of money with its currency type. |
| `error` | `object` | The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). |
| `encryptionSpec` | `object` | Represents a customer-managed encryption key spec that can be applied to a top-level resource. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `dataLabelingJobsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Gets a DataLabelingJob. |
| `list` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Lists DataLabelingJobs in a Location. |
| `create` | `INSERT` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Creates a DataLabelingJob. |
| `delete` | `DELETE` | `dataLabelingJobsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Deletes a DataLabelingJob. |
| `_list` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Lists DataLabelingJobs in a Location. |
| `cancel` | `EXEC` | `dataLabelingJobsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Cancels a DataLabelingJob. Success of cancellation is not guaranteed. |
