## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | Required. The name of the Snooze. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/snoozes/[SNOOZE_ID] The ID of the Snooze will be generated by the system. |
| <CopyableCode code="criteria" /> | `object` | Criteria specific to the AlertPolicys that this Snooze applies to. The Snooze will suppress alerts that come from one of the AlertPolicys whose names are supplied. |
| <CopyableCode code="displayName" /> | `string` | Required. A display name for the Snooze. This can be, at most, 512 unicode characters. |
| <CopyableCode code="interval" /> | `object` | Describes a time interval: Reads: A half-open time interval. It includes the end time but excludes the start time: (startTime, endTime]. The start time must be specified, must be earlier than the end time, and should be no older than the data retention period for the metric. Writes: A closed time interval. It extends from the start time to the end time, and includes both: [startTime, endTime]. Valid time intervals depend on the MetricKind (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors#MetricKind) of the metric value. The end time must not be earlier than the start time, and the end time must not be more than 25 hours in the past or more than five minutes in the future. For GAUGE metrics, the startTime value is technically optional; if no value is specified, the start time defaults to the value of the end time, and the interval represents a single point in time. If both start and end times are specified, they must be identical. Such an interval is valid only for GAUGE metrics, which are point-in-time measurements. The end time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For DELTA metrics, the start time and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying contiguous and non-overlapping intervals. For DELTA metrics, the start time of the next interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For CUMULATIVE metrics, the start time and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying the same start time and increasing end times, until an event resets the cumulative value to zero and sets a new start time for the following points. The new start time must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. The start time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval because intervals are closed. If the start time of a new interval is the same as the end time of the previous interval, then data written at the new start time could overwrite data written at the previous end time. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="projects_snoozes_get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId, snoozesId" /> | Retrieves a Snooze by name. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_snoozes_list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId" /> | Lists the Snoozes associated with a project. Can optionally pass in filter, which specifies predicates to match Snoozes. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_snoozes_create" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId" /> | Creates a Snooze that will prevent alerts, which match the provided criteria, from being opened. The Snooze applies for a specific time interval. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_snoozes_patch" /> | `UPDATE` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId, snoozesId" /> | Updates a Snooze, identified by its name, with the parameters in the given Snooze object. |
| <CopyableCode code="_projects_snoozes_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId" /> | Lists the Snoozes associated with a project. Can optionally pass in filter, which specifies predicates to match Snoozes. |
