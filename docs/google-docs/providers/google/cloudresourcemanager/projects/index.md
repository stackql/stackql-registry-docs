## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | Output only. The unique resource name of the project. It is an int64 generated number prefixed by "projects/". Example: `projects/415104041262` |
| `projectId` | `string` | Immutable. The unique, user-assigned id of the project. It must be 6 to 30 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, or hyphens. It must start with a letter. Trailing hyphens are prohibited. Example: `tokyo-rain-123` |
| `updateTime` | `string` | Output only. The most recent time this resource was modified. |
| `labels` | `object` | Optional. The labels associated with this project. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: \[a-z\](\[-a-z0-9\]*\[a-z0-9\])?. Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression (\[a-z\](\[-a-z0-9\]*\[a-z0-9\])?)?. No more than 256 labels can be associated with a given resource. Clients should store labels in a representation such as JSON that does not depend on specific characters being disallowed. Example: `"myBusinessDimension" : "businessValue"` |
| `displayName` | `string` | Optional. A user-assigned display name of the project. When present it must be between 4 to 30 characters. Allowed characters are: lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, hyphen, single-quote, double-quote, space, and exclamation point. Example: `My Project` |
| `etag` | `string` | Output only. A checksum computed by the server based on the current value of the Project resource. This may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. |
| `createTime` | `string` | Output only. Creation time. |
| `parent` | `string` | Optional. A reference to a parent Resource. eg., `organizations/123` or `folders/876`. |
| `state` | `string` | Output only. The project lifecycle state. |
| `deleteTime` | `string` | Output only. The time at which this resource was requested for deletion. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `projectsId` | Retrieves the project identified by the specified `name` (for example, `projects/415104041262`). The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission for this project. |
| `list` | `SELECT` |  | Lists projects that are direct children of the specified folder or organization resource. `list()` provides a strongly consistent view of the projects underneath the specified parent resource. `list()` returns projects sorted based upon the (ascending) lexical ordering of their `display_name`. The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the identified parent. |
| `create` | `INSERT` |  | Request that a new project be created. The result is an `Operation` which can be used to track the creation process. This process usually takes a few seconds, but can sometimes take much longer. The tracking `Operation` is automatically deleted after a few hours, so there is no need to call `DeleteOperation`. |
| `delete` | `DELETE` | `projectsId` | Marks the project identified by the specified `name` (for example, `projects/415104041262`) for deletion. This method will only affect the project if it has a lifecycle state of ACTIVE. This method changes the Project's lifecycle state from ACTIVE to DELETE_REQUESTED. The deletion starts at an unspecified time, at which point the Project is no longer accessible. Until the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state checked by retrieving the project with GetProject, and the project remains visible to ListProjects. However, you cannot update the project. After the deletion completes, the project is not retrievable by the GetProject, ListProjects, and SearchProjects methods. This method behaves idempotently, such that deleting a `DELETE_REQUESTED` project will not cause an error, but also won't do anything. The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.delete` permissions for this project. |
| `move` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Move a project to another place in your resource hierarchy, under a new resource parent. Returns an operation which can be used to track the process of the project move workflow. Upon success, the `Operation.response` field will be populated with the moved project. The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.move` permission on the project, on the project's current and proposed new parent. If project has no current parent, or it currently does not have an associated organization resource, you will also need the `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` permission in the project.  |
| `patch` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Updates the `display_name` and labels of the project identified by the specified `name` (for example, `projects/415104041262`). Deleting all labels requires an update mask for labels field. The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.update` permission for this project. |
| `search` | `EXEC` |  | Search for projects that the caller has both `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission on, and also satisfy the specified query. This method returns projects in an unspecified order. This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To retrieve the latest state of a project, use the GetProject method. |
| `undelete` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Restores the project identified by the specified `name` (for example, `projects/415104041262`). You can only use this method for a project that has a lifecycle state of DELETE_REQUESTED. After deletion starts, the project cannot be restored. The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.undelete` permission for this project. |
