## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="condition" /> | `object` | Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() < 100" Example (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information. |
| <CopyableCode code="members" /> | `array` | Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A single identity in a workforce identity pool. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id}`: All workforce identities in a group. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}`: All workforce identities with a specific attribute value. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/*`: All identities in a workforce identity pool. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A single identity in a workload identity pool. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id}`: A workload identity pool group. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}`: All identities in a workload identity pool with a certain attribute. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/*`: All identities in a workload identity pool. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: Deleted single identity in a workforce identity pool. For example, `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value`. |
| <CopyableCode code="role" /> | `string` | Role that is assigned to the list of `members`, or principals. For example, `roles/viewer`, `roles/editor`, or `roles/owner`. For an overview of the IAM roles and permissions, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview). For a list of the available pre-defined roles, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles). |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="get_iam_policy" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId" /> | Returns the IAM access control policy for the specified project, in the format `projects/{ProjectIdOrNumber}` e.g. projects/123. Permission is denied if the policy or the resource do not exist. |
| <CopyableCode code="set_iam_policy" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId" /> | Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified project, in the format `projects/{ProjectIdOrNumber}` e.g. projects/123. CAUTION: This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to append additional IAM settings. Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand how the service account is being used before removing or updating its roles. The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`: + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`. + The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group that is part of an organization. For example, group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com organization. + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be invited using the Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation. + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must explicitly accept the invitation. + Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using `setIamPolicy()`; they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console. + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is rectified. If the project is part of an organization, you can remove all owners, potentially making the organization inaccessible. |
| <CopyableCode code="test_iam_permissions" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="projectsId" /> | Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified project, in the format `projects/{ProjectIdOrNumber}` e.g. projects/123.. |

## `SELECT` examples

Returns the IAM access control policy for the specified project, in the format `projects/{ProjectIdOrNumber}` e.g. projects/123. Permission is denied if the policy or the resource do not exist.
