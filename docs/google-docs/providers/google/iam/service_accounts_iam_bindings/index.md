## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `members` | `array` | Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:&#123;emailid&#125;`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:&#123;emailid&#125;`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:&#123;projectid&#125;.svc.id.goog[&#123;namespace&#125;/&#123;kubernetes-sa&#125;]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. * `group:&#123;emailid&#125;`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:&#123;emailid&#125;?uid=&#123;uniqueid&#125;`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:&#123;emailid&#125;` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:&#123;emailid&#125;?uid=&#123;uniqueid&#125;`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:&#123;emailid&#125;` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:&#123;emailid&#125;?uid=&#123;uniqueid&#125;`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:&#123;emailid&#125;` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:&#123;domain&#125;`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`.  |
| `role` | `string` | Role that is assigned to the list of `members`, or principals. For example, `roles/viewer`, `roles/editor`, or `roles/owner`. |
| `condition` | `object` | Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() &lt; 100" Example (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information. |
