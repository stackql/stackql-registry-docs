|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `search` | `EXEC` |  | The Cloud Search Query API provides the search method, which returns the most relevant results from a user query. The results can come from Google Workspace apps, such as Gmail or Google Drive, or they can come from data that you have indexed from a third party. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute. A service account can't perform Query API requests directly; to use a service account to perform queries, set up [Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/delegation/). |
| `suggest` | `EXEC` |  | Provides suggestions for autocompleting the query. **Note:** This API requires a standard end user account to execute. A service account can't perform Query API requests directly; to use a service account to perform queries, set up [Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/delegation/). |
