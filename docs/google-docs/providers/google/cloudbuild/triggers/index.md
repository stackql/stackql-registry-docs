## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | `string` | Output only. Unique identifier of the trigger. |
| `name` | `string` | User-assigned name of the trigger. Must be unique within the project. Trigger names must meet the following requirements: + They must contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes. + They can be 1-64 characters long. + They must begin and end with an alphanumeric character. |
| `description` | `string` | Human-readable description of this trigger. |
| `serviceAccount` | `string` | The service account used for all user-controlled operations including UpdateBuildTrigger, RunBuildTrigger, CreateBuild, and CancelBuild. If no service account is set, then the standard Cloud Build service account ([PROJECT_NUM]@system.gserviceaccount.com) will be used instead. Format: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_ID_OR_EMAIL}` |
| `eventType` | `string` | EventType allows the user to explicitly set the type of event to which this BuildTrigger should respond. This field will be validated against the rest of the configuration if it is set. |
| `autodetect` | `boolean` | Autodetect build configuration. The following precedence is used (case insensitive): 1. cloudbuild.yaml 2. cloudbuild.yml 3. cloudbuild.json 4. Dockerfile Currently only available for GitHub App Triggers. |
| `build` | `object` | A build resource in the Cloud Build API. At a high level, a `Build` describes where to find source code, how to build it (for example, the builder image to run on the source), and where to store the built artifacts. Fields can include the following variables, which will be expanded when the build is created: - $PROJECT_ID: the project ID of the build. - $PROJECT_NUMBER: the project number of the build. - $LOCATION: the location/region of the build. - $BUILD_ID: the autogenerated ID of the build. - $REPO_NAME: the source repository name specified by RepoSource. - $BRANCH_NAME: the branch name specified by RepoSource. - $TAG_NAME: the tag name specified by RepoSource. - $REVISION_ID or $COMMIT_SHA: the commit SHA specified by RepoSource or resolved from the specified branch or tag. - $SHORT_SHA: first 7 characters of $REVISION_ID or $COMMIT_SHA. |
| `createTime` | `string` | Output only. Time when the trigger was created. |
| `resourceName` | `string` | The `Trigger` name with format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/triggers/{trigger}`, where {trigger} is a unique identifier generated by the service. |
| `triggerTemplate` | `object` | Location of the source in a Google Cloud Source Repository. |
| `includeBuildLogs` | `string` | If set to INCLUDE_BUILD_LOGS_WITH_STATUS, log url will be shown on GitHub page when build status is final. Setting this field to INCLUDE_BUILD_LOGS_WITH_STATUS for non GitHub triggers results in INVALID_ARGUMENT error. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | If true, the trigger will never automatically execute a build. |
| `substitutions` | `object` | Substitutions for Build resource. The keys must match the following regular expression: `^_[A-Z0-9_]+$`. |
| `pubsubConfig` | `object` | PubsubConfig describes the configuration of a trigger that creates a build whenever a Pub/Sub message is published. |
| `bitbucketServerTriggerConfig` | `object` | BitbucketServerTriggerConfig describes the configuration of a trigger that creates a build whenever a Bitbucket Server event is received. |
| `sourceToBuild` | `object` | GitRepoSource describes a repo and ref of a code repository. |
| `gitFileSource` | `object` | GitFileSource describes a file within a (possibly remote) code repository. |
| `approvalConfig` | `object` | ApprovalConfig describes configuration for manual approval of a build. |
| `ignoredFiles` | `array` | ignored_files and included_files are file glob matches using https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match extended with support for "**". If ignored_files and changed files are both empty, then they are not used to determine whether or not to trigger a build. If ignored_files is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside of the ignored_files globs, then we do not trigger a build. |
| `includedFiles` | `array` | If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignored_files filter and included_files is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we should trigger the build. If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignored_files filter and included_files is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of those files matches a included_files glob. If not, then we do not trigger a build. |
| `webhookConfig` | `object` | WebhookConfig describes the configuration of a trigger that creates a build whenever a webhook is sent to a trigger's webhook URL. |
| `github` | `object` | GitHubEventsConfig describes the configuration of a trigger that creates a build whenever a GitHub event is received. |
| `tags` | `array` | Tags for annotation of a `BuildTrigger` |
| `filename` | `string` | Path, from the source root, to the build configuration file (i.e. cloudbuild.yaml). |
| `filter` | `string` | A Common Expression Language string. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_triggers_get` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, projectsId, triggersId` | Returns information about a `BuildTrigger`. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_locations_triggers_list` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Lists existing `BuildTrigger`s. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_triggers_get` | `SELECT` | `projectId, triggerId` | Returns information about a `BuildTrigger`. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_triggers_list` | `SELECT` | `projectId` | Lists existing `BuildTrigger`s. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_locations_triggers_create` | `INSERT` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Creates a new `BuildTrigger`. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_triggers_create` | `INSERT` | `projectId` | Creates a new `BuildTrigger`. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_locations_triggers_delete` | `DELETE` | `locationsId, projectsId, triggersId` | Deletes a `BuildTrigger` by its project ID and trigger ID. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_triggers_delete` | `DELETE` | `projectId, triggerId` | Deletes a `BuildTrigger` by its project ID and trigger ID. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_locations_triggers_patch` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, triggersId` | Updates a `BuildTrigger` by its project ID and trigger ID. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_locations_triggers_run` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, triggersId` | Runs a `BuildTrigger` at a particular source revision. To run a regional or global trigger, use the POST request that includes the location endpoint in the path. The POST request that does not include the location endpoint in the path can only be used when running global triggers. |
| `projects_locations_triggers_webhook` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId, triggersId` | ReceiveTriggerWebhook [Experimental] is called when the API receives a webhook request targeted at a specific trigger. |
| `projects_triggers_patch` | `EXEC` | `projectId, triggerId` | Updates a `BuildTrigger` by its project ID and trigger ID. This API is experimental. |
| `projects_triggers_run` | `EXEC` | `projectId, triggerId` | Runs a `BuildTrigger` at a particular source revision. To run a regional or global trigger, use the POST request that includes the location endpoint in the path. The POST request that does not include the location endpoint in the path can only be used when running global triggers. |
