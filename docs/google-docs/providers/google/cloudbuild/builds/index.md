| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | Output only. The 'Build' name with format: `projects/&#123;project&#125;/locations/&#123;location&#125;/builds/&#123;build&#125;`, where &#123;build&#125; is a unique identifier generated by the service. |
| <CopyableCode code="approval" /> | `object` | BuildApproval describes a build's approval configuration, state, and result. |
| <CopyableCode code="artifacts" /> | `object` | Artifacts produced by a build that should be uploaded upon successful completion of all build steps. |
| <CopyableCode code="availableSecrets" /> | `object` | Secrets and secret environment variables. |
| <CopyableCode code="buildTriggerId" /> | `string` | Output only. The ID of the `BuildTrigger` that triggered this build, if it was triggered automatically. |
| <CopyableCode code="createTime" /> | `string` | Output only. Time at which the request to create the build was received. |
| <CopyableCode code="failureInfo" /> | `object` | A fatal problem encountered during the execution of the build. |
| <CopyableCode code="finishTime" /> | `string` | Output only. Time at which execution of the build was finished. The difference between finish_time and start_time is the duration of the build's execution. |
| <CopyableCode code="images" /> | `array` | A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build steps. The images are pushed using the builder service account's credentials. The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the `Build` resource's results field. If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build status is marked `FAILURE`. |
| <CopyableCode code="logUrl" /> | `string` | Output only. URL to logs for this build in Google Cloud Console. |
| <CopyableCode code="logsBucket" /> | `string` | Cloud Storage bucket where logs should be written (see [Bucket Name Requirements](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-naming#requirements)). Logs file names will be of the format `$&#123;logs_bucket&#125;/log-$&#123;build_id&#125;.txt`. |
| <CopyableCode code="options" /> | `object` | Optional arguments to enable specific features of builds. |
| <CopyableCode code="projectId" /> | `string` | Output only. ID of the project. |
| <CopyableCode code="queueTtl" /> | `string` | TTL in queue for this build. If provided and the build is enqueued longer than this value, the build will expire and the build status will be `EXPIRED`. The TTL starts ticking from create_time. |
| <CopyableCode code="results" /> | `object` | Artifacts created by the build pipeline. |
| <CopyableCode code="secrets" /> | `array` | Secrets to decrypt using Cloud Key Management Service. Note: Secret Manager is the recommended technique for managing sensitive data with Cloud Build. Use `available_secrets` to configure builds to access secrets from Secret Manager. For instructions, see: https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/securing-builds/use-secrets |
| <CopyableCode code="serviceAccount" /> | `string` | IAM service account whose credentials will be used at build runtime. Must be of the format `projects/&#123;PROJECT_ID&#125;/serviceAccounts/&#123;ACCOUNT&#125;`. ACCOUNT can be email address or uniqueId of the service account.  |
| <CopyableCode code="source" /> | `object` | Location of the source in a supported storage service. |
| <CopyableCode code="sourceProvenance" /> | `object` | Provenance of the source. Ways to find the original source, or verify that some source was used for this build. |
| <CopyableCode code="startTime" /> | `string` | Output only. Time at which execution of the build was started. |
| <CopyableCode code="status" /> | `string` | Output only. Status of the build. |
| <CopyableCode code="statusDetail" /> | `string` | Output only. Customer-readable message about the current status. |
| <CopyableCode code="steps" /> | `array` | Required. The operations to be performed on the workspace. |
| <CopyableCode code="substitutions" /> | `object` | Substitutions data for `Build` resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="tags" /> | `array` | Tags for annotation of a `Build`. These are not docker tags. |
| <CopyableCode code="timeout" /> | `string` | Amount of time that this build should be allowed to run, to second granularity. If this amount of time elapses, work on the build will cease and the build status will be `TIMEOUT`. `timeout` starts ticking from `startTime`. Default time is 60 minutes. |
| <CopyableCode code="timing" /> | `object` | Output only. Stores timing information for phases of the build. Valid keys are: * BUILD: time to execute all build steps. * PUSH: time to push all artifacts including docker images and non docker artifacts. * FETCHSOURCE: time to fetch source. * SETUPBUILD: time to set up build. If the build does not specify source or images, these keys will not be included. |
| <CopyableCode code="warnings" /> | `array` | Output only. Non-fatal problems encountered during the execution of the build. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="projects_builds_get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="id, projectId" /> | Returns information about a previously requested build. The `Build` that is returned includes its status (such as `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `WORKING`), and timing information. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_builds_list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="projectId" /> | Lists previously requested builds. Previously requested builds may still be in-progress, or may have finished successfully or unsuccessfully. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_builds_get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="buildsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Returns information about a previously requested build. The `Build` that is returned includes its status (such as `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `WORKING`), and timing information. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_builds_list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId" /> | Lists previously requested builds. Previously requested builds may still be in-progress, or may have finished successfully or unsuccessfully. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_builds_create" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="projectId" /> | Starts a build with the specified configuration. This method returns a long-running `Operation`, which includes the build ID. Pass the build ID to `GetBuild` to determine the build status (such as `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`). |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_builds_create" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId" /> | Starts a build with the specified configuration. This method returns a long-running `Operation`, which includes the build ID. Pass the build ID to `GetBuild` to determine the build status (such as `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`). |
| <CopyableCode code="_projects_builds_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="projectId" /> | Lists previously requested builds. Previously requested builds may still be in-progress, or may have finished successfully or unsuccessfully. |
| <CopyableCode code="_projects_locations_builds_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="locationsId, projectsId" /> | Lists previously requested builds. Previously requested builds may still be in-progress, or may have finished successfully or unsuccessfully. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_builds_approve" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="buildsId, projectsId" /> | Approves or rejects a pending build. If approved, the returned LRO will be analogous to the LRO returned from a CreateBuild call. If rejected, the returned LRO will be immediately done. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_builds_cancel" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="id, projectId" /> | Cancels a build in progress. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_builds_retry" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="id, projectId" /> | Creates a new build based on the specified build. This method creates a new build using the original build request, which may or may not result in an identical build. For triggered builds: * Triggered builds resolve to a precise revision; therefore a retry of a triggered build will result in a build that uses the same revision. For non-triggered builds that specify `RepoSource`: * If the original build built from the tip of a branch, the retried build will build from the tip of that branch, which may not be the same revision as the original build. * If the original build specified a commit sha or revision ID, the retried build will use the identical source. For builds that specify `StorageSource`: * If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage without specifying the generation of the object, the new build will use the current object, which may be different from the original build source. * If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage and specified the generation of the object, the new build will attempt to use the same object, which may or may not be available depending on the bucket's lifecycle management settings. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_builds_approve" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="buildsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Approves or rejects a pending build. If approved, the returned LRO will be analogous to the LRO returned from a CreateBuild call. If rejected, the returned LRO will be immediately done. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_builds_cancel" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="buildsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Cancels a build in progress. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_builds_retry" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="buildsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Creates a new build based on the specified build. This method creates a new build using the original build request, which may or may not result in an identical build. For triggered builds: * Triggered builds resolve to a precise revision; therefore a retry of a triggered build will result in a build that uses the same revision. For non-triggered builds that specify `RepoSource`: * If the original build built from the tip of a branch, the retried build will build from the tip of that branch, which may not be the same revision as the original build. * If the original build specified a commit sha or revision ID, the retried build will use the identical source. For builds that specify `StorageSource`: * If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage without specifying the generation of the object, the new build will use the current object, which may be different from the original build source. * If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage and specified the generation of the object, the new build will attempt to use the same object, which may or may not be available depending on the bucket's lifecycle management settings. |
