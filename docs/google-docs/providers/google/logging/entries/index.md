`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource and then invoke a supported method using the `EXEC` command  
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="entries_copy" /> | `EXEC` |  | Copies a set of log entries from a log bucket to a Cloud Storage bucket. |
| <CopyableCode code="entries_list" /> | `EXEC` |  | Lists log entries. Use this method to retrieve log entries that originated from a project/folder/organization/billing account. For ways to export log entries, see Exporting Logs (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export). |
| <CopyableCode code="entries_tail" /> | `EXEC` |  | Streaming read of log entries as they are received. Until the stream is terminated, it will continue reading logs. |
| <CopyableCode code="entries_write" /> | `EXEC` |  | Writes log entries to Logging. This API method is the only way to send log entries to Logging. This method is used, directly or indirectly, by the Logging agent (fluentd) and all logging libraries configured to use Logging. A single request may contain log entries for a maximum of 1000 different resource names (projects, organizations, billing accounts or folders), where the resource name for a log entry is determined from its logName field. |
