## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, operationsId, projectsId` | Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `lifesciences.operations.get` |
| `list` | `SELECT` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `lifesciences.operations.list` |
| `cancel` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, operationsId, projectsId` | Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed.
