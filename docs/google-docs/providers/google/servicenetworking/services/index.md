## Fields
`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource and then invoke a supported method using the `EXEC` command  
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `disableVpcServiceControls` | `EXEC` | `servicesId` | Disables VPC service controls for a connection. |
| `enableVpcServiceControls` | `EXEC` | `servicesId` | Enables VPC service controls for a connection. |
| `searchRange` | `EXEC` | `servicesId` | Service producers can use this method to find a currently unused range within consumer allocated ranges. This returned range is not reserved, and not guaranteed to remain unused. It will validate previously provided allocated ranges, find non-conflicting sub-range of requested size (expressed in number of leading bits of ipv4 network mask, as in CIDR range notation). |
| `validate` | `EXEC` | `servicesId` | Service producers use this method to validate if the consumer provided network, project and requested range are valid. This allows them to use a fail-fast mechanism for consumer requests, and not have to wait for AddSubnetwork operation completion to determine if user request is invalid. |
