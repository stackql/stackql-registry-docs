Creates, updates, deletes, gets or lists a <code>sync_authorization</code> resource.

## Overview
<table><tbody>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><code>sync_authorization</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td>Resource</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><CopyableCode code="google.apigee.sync_authorization" /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="etag" /> | `string` | Entity tag (ETag) used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates from overwriting each other. For example, when you call [getSyncAuthorization](organizations/getSyncAuthorization) an ETag is returned in the response. Pass that ETag when calling the [setSyncAuthorization](organizations/setSyncAuthorization) to ensure that you are updating the correct version. If you don't pass the ETag in the call to `setSyncAuthorization`, then the existing authorization is overwritten indiscriminately. **Note**: We strongly recommend that you use the ETag in the read-modify-write cycle to avoid race conditions. |
| <CopyableCode code="identities" /> | `array` | Required. Array of service accounts to grant access to control plane resources, each specified using the following format: `serviceAccount:` service-account-name. The service-account-name is formatted like an email address. For example: `my-synchronizer-manager-service_account@my_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com` You might specify multiple service accounts, for example, if you have multiple environments and wish to assign a unique service account to each one. The service accounts must have **Apigee Synchronizer Manager** role. See also [Create service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/latest/sa-about#create-the-service-accounts). |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="organizations_get_sync_authorization" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="organizationsId" /> | Lists the service accounts with the permissions required to allow the Synchronizer to download environment data from the control plane. An ETag is returned in the response to `getSyncAuthorization`. Pass that ETag when calling [setSyncAuthorization](setSyncAuthorization) to ensure that you are updating the correct version. If you don't pass the ETag in the call to `setSyncAuthorization`, then the existing authorization is overwritten indiscriminately. For more information, see [Configure the Synchronizer](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/latest/synchronizer-access). **Note**: Available to Apigee hybrid only. |

## `SELECT` examples

Lists the service accounts with the permissions required to allow the Synchronizer to download environment data from the control plane. An ETag is returned in the response to `getSyncAuthorization`. Pass that ETag when calling [setSyncAuthorization](setSyncAuthorization) to ensure that you are updating the correct version. If you don't pass the ETag in the call to `setSyncAuthorization`, then the existing authorization is overwritten indiscriminately. For more information, see [Configure the Synchronizer](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/latest/synchronizer-access). **Note**: Available to Apigee hybrid only.
