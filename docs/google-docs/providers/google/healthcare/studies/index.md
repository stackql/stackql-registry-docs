`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource and then invoke a supported method using the `EXEC` command  
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_datasets_dicomStores_studies_delete` | `DELETE` | `datasetsId, dicomStoresId, locationsId, projectsId, studiesId` | DeleteStudy deletes all instances within the given study. Delete requests are equivalent to the GET requests specified in the Retrieve transaction. The method returns an Operation which will be marked successful when the deletion is complete. Warning: Instances cannot be inserted into a study that is being deleted by an operation until the operation completes. For samples that show how to call DeleteStudy, see [Deleting a study, series, or instance](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicomweb#deleting_a_study_series_or_instance). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_dicomStores_studies_searchForInstances` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, dicomStoresId, locationsId, projectsId, studiesId` | SearchForInstances returns a list of matching instances. See [Search Transaction] (http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_10.6). For details on the implementation of SearchForInstances, see [Search transaction](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/dicom#search_transaction) in the Cloud Healthcare API conformance statement. For samples that show how to call SearchForInstances, see [Searching for studies, series, instances, and frames](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicomweb#searching_for_studies_series_instances_and_frames). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_dicomStores_studies_searchForSeries` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, dicomStoresId, locationsId, projectsId, studiesId` | SearchForSeries returns a list of matching series. See [Search Transaction] (http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_10.6). For details on the implementation of SearchForSeries, see [Search transaction](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/dicom#search_transaction) in the Cloud Healthcare API conformance statement. For samples that show how to call SearchForSeries, see [Searching for studies, series, instances, and frames](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicomweb#searching_for_studies_series_instances_and_frames). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_dicomStores_studies_storeInstances` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, dicomStoresId, locationsId, projectsId, studiesId` | StoreInstances stores DICOM instances associated with study instance unique identifiers (SUID). See [Store Transaction] (http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_10.5). For details on the implementation of StoreInstances, see [Store transaction](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/dicom#store_transaction) in the Cloud Healthcare API conformance statement. For samples that show how to call StoreInstances, see [Storing DICOM data](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicomweb#storing_dicom_data). |
