## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_datasets_dicomStores_studies_series_delete` | `DELETE` | `datasetsId, dicomStoresId, locationsId, projectsId, seriesId, studiesId` | DeleteSeries deletes all instances within the given study and series. Delete requests are equivalent to the GET requests specified in the Retrieve transaction. The method returns an Operation which will be marked successful when the deletion is complete. Warning: Instances cannot be inserted into a series that is being deleted by an operation until the operation completes. For samples that show how to call DeleteSeries, see [Deleting a study, series, or instance](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicomweb#deleting_a_study_series_or_instance). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_dicomStores_studies_series_searchForInstances` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, dicomStoresId, locationsId, projectsId, seriesId, studiesId` | SearchForInstances returns a list of matching instances. See [Search Transaction] (http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_10.6). For details on the implementation of SearchForInstances, see [Search transaction](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/dicom#search_transaction) in the Cloud Healthcare API conformance statement. For samples that show how to call SearchForInstances, see [Searching for studies, series, instances, and frames](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicomweb#searching_for_studies_series_instances_and_frames). |
