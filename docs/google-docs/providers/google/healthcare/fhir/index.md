## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `data` | `string` | The HTTP request/response body as raw binary. |
| `extensions` | `array` | Application specific response metadata. Must be set in the first response for streaming APIs. |
| `contentType` | `string` | The HTTP Content-Type header value specifying the content type of the body. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_read` | `SELECT` | `datasetsId, fhirId, fhirId1, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Gets the contents of a FHIR resource. Implements the FHIR standard read interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#read), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#read), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#read)). Also supports the FHIR standard conditional read interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#cread), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#cread), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#cread)) specified by supplying an `If-Modified-Since` header with a date/time value or an `If-None-Match` header with an ETag value. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the resource. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `read`, see [Getting a FHIR resource](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#getting_a_fhir_resource). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_create` | `INSERT` | `datasetsId, fhirId, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Creates a FHIR resource. Implements the FHIR standard create interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#create), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#create), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#create)), which creates a new resource with a server-assigned resource ID. The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the resource as it was created on the server, including the server-assigned resource ID and version ID. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `create`, see [Creating a FHIR resource](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#creating_a_fhir_resource). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_delete` | `DELETE` | `datasetsId, fhirId, fhirId1, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Deletes a FHIR resource. Implements the FHIR standard delete interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#delete), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#delete), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#delete)). Note: Unless resource versioning is disabled by setting the disable_resource_versioning flag on the FHIR store, the deleted resources will be moved to a history repository that can still be retrieved through vread and related methods, unless they are removed by the purge method. For samples that show how to call `delete`, see [Deleting a FHIR resource](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#deleting_a_fhir_resource). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_Patient_everything` | `EXEC` | `PatientId, datasetsId, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Retrieves a Patient resource and resources related to that patient. Implements the FHIR extended operation Patient-everything ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/patient-operations.html#everything), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/patient-operations.html#everything), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/patient-operations.html#everything)). On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the operation. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The resources in scope for the response are: * The patient resource itself. * All the resources directly referenced by the patient resource. * Resources directly referencing the patient resource that meet the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria are based on the membership rules in the patient compartment definition ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/compartment-patient.html), [STU3](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/compartmentdefinition-patient.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/compartmentdefinition-patient.html)), which details the eligible resource types and referencing search parameters. For samples that show how to call `Patient-everything`, see [Getting all patient compartment resources](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#getting_all_patient_compartment_resources). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_Resource_purge` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirId, fhirId1, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Deletes all the historical versions of a resource (excluding the current version) from the FHIR store. To remove all versions of a resource, first delete the current version and then call this method. This is not a FHIR standard operation. For samples that show how to call `Resource-purge`, see [Deleting historical versions of a FHIR resource](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#deleting_historical_versions_of_a_fhir_resource). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_Resource_validate` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirId, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Validates an input FHIR resource's conformance to its profiles and the profiles configured on the FHIR store. Implements the FHIR extended operation $validate ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/resource-operations.html#validate), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/resource-operations.html#validate), or [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/resource-operation-validate.html)). The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. The `Parameters` input syntax is not supported. The `profile` query parameter can be used to request that the resource only be validated against a specific profile. If a profile with the given URL cannot be found in the FHIR store then an error is returned. Errors generated by validation contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_capabilities` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Gets the FHIR capability statement ([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/capabilitystatement.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/capabilitystatement.html)), or the [conformance statement](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/conformance.html) in the DSTU2 case for the store, which contains a description of functionality supported by the server. Implements the FHIR standard capabilities interaction ([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#capabilities), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities)), or the [conformance interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#conformance) in the DSTU2 case. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `CapabilityStatement` resource. |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_executeBundle` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Executes all the requests in the given Bundle. Implements the FHIR standard batch/transaction interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#transaction), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#transaction), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#transaction)). Supports all interactions within a bundle, except search. This method accepts Bundles of type `batch` and `transaction`, processing them according to the batch processing rules ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.16.1), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.1), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#brules)) and transaction processing rules ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.16.2), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.2), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#trules)). The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR `Bundle` resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. For a batch bundle or a successful transaction the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `batch-response` or `transaction-response` containing one entry for each entry in the request, with the outcome of processing the entry. In the case of an error for a transaction bundle, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `executeBundle`, see [Managing FHIR resources using FHIR bundles](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-bundles). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_history` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirId, fhirId1, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Lists all the versions of a resource (including the current version and deleted versions) from the FHIR store. Implements the per-resource form of the FHIR standard history interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#history), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#history), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#history)). On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `history`, containing the version history sorted from most recent to oldest versions. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `history`, see [Listing FHIR resource versions](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#listing_fhir_resource_versions). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_patch` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirId, fhirId1, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Updates part of an existing resource by applying the operations specified in a [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) document. Implements the FHIR standard patch interaction ([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#patch), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#patch)). DSTU2 doesn't define a patch method, but the server supports it in the same way it supports STU3. The request body must contain a JSON Patch document, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/json-patch+json`. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `patch`, see [Patching a FHIR resource](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#patching_a_fhir_resource). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_search` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Searches for resources in the given FHIR store according to criteria specified as query parameters. Implements the FHIR standard search interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#search), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#search)) using the search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/search.html), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/search.html)). Supports four methods of search defined by the specification: * `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources. * `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified type. * `POST [base]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method across all resources. * `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method for the specified type. The `GET` and `POST` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the search. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The server's capability statement, retrieved through capabilities, indicates what search parameters are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters defined by the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter Registry ([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/searchparameter-registry.html)). FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource's definition page. Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`, `:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`. Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`, `_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`. The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. If there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` contains a link of `relation` "next", which has a `_page_token` parameter for an opaque pagination token that can be used to retrieve the next page. Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than 50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated search index in those cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight delay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change is reflected in search results. For samples and detailed information, see [Searching for FHIR resources](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-search) and [Advanced FHIR search features](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-advanced-search). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_search_type` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId, resourceType` | Searches for resources in the given FHIR store according to criteria specified as query parameters. Implements the FHIR standard search interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#search), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#search)) using the search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/search.html), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/search.html)). Supports four methods of search defined by the specification: * `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources. * `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified type. * `POST [base]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method across all resources. * `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method for the specified type. The `GET` and `POST` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the search. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The server's capability statement, retrieved through capabilities, indicates what search parameters are supported on each FHIR resource.

FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource's definition page. Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`, `:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`. Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`, `_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`.

| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_update` | `EXEC` | `datasetsId, fhirId, fhirId1, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Updates the entire contents of a resource. Implements the FHIR standard update interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#update), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#update), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#update)). If the specified resource does not exist and the FHIR store has enable_update_create set, creates the resource with the client-specified ID. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. The resource must contain an `id` element having an identical value to the ID in the REST path of the request. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `update`, see [Updating a FHIR resource](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#updating_a_fhir_resource). |
| `projects_locations_datasets_fhirStores_fhir_vread` | `EXEC` | `_historyId, datasetsId, fhirId, fhirId1, fhirStoresId, locationsId, projectsId` | Gets the contents of a version (current or historical) of a FHIR resource by version ID. Implements the FHIR standard vread interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#vread), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#vread), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#vread)). On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the resource. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `vread`, see [Retrieving a FHIR resource version](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#retrieving_a_fhir_resource_version). |
