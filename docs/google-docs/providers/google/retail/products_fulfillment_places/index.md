## Fields
`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource and then invoke a supported method using the `EXEC` command  
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_add_fulfillment_places` | `EXEC` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId` | We recommend that you use the ProductService.AddLocalInventories method instead of the ProductService.AddFulfillmentPlaces method. ProductService.AddLocalInventories achieves the same results but provides more fine-grained control over ingesting local inventory data. Incrementally adds place IDs to Product.fulfillment_info.place_ids. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, the added place IDs are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. The returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done until being obsolete. |
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_remove_fulfillment_places` | `EXEC` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId` | We recommend that you use the ProductService.RemoveLocalInventories method instead of the ProductService.RemoveFulfillmentPlaces method. ProductService.RemoveLocalInventories achieves the same results but provides more fine-grained control over ingesting local inventory data. Incrementally removes place IDs from a Product.fulfillment_info.place_ids. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, the removed place IDs are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts.
