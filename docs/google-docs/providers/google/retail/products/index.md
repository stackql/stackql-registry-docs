Strongly recommended using the full path for better search / recommendation quality. To represent full path of category, use '&gt;' sign to separate different hierarchies. If '&gt;' is part of the category name, please replace it with other character(s). For example, if a shoes product belongs to both ["Shoes & Accessories" -&gt; "Shoes"] and ["Sports & Fitness" -&gt; "Athletic Clothing" -&gt; "Shoes"], it could be represented as: "categories": [ "Shoes & Accessories &gt; Shoes", "Sports & Fitness &gt; Athletic Clothing &gt; Shoes" ] Must be set for Type.PRIMARY Product otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

| `languageCode` | `string` | Language of the title/description and other string attributes. Use language tags defined by [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt). For product prediction, this field is ignored and the model automatically detects the text language. The Product can include text in different languages, but duplicating Products to provide text in multiple languages can result in degraded model performance. For product search this field is in use. It defaults to "en-US" if unset. |

Do not set this field in API requests. |
| `attributes` | `object` | Highly encouraged. Extra product attributes to be included. For example, for products, this could include the store name, vendor, style, color, etc. These are very strong signals for recommendation model, thus we highly recommend providing the attributes here. Features that can take on one of a limited number of possible values. Two types of features can be set are: Textual features. some examples would be the brand/maker of a product, or country of a customer. Numerical features. Some examples would be the height/weight of a product, or age of a customer. For example: `{ "vendor": {"text": ["vendor123", "vendor456"]}, "lengths_cm": {"numbers":[2.3, 15.4]}, "heights_cm": {"numbers":[8.1, 6.4]} }`. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned: * Max entries count: 200. * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. * For indexable attribute, the key must match the pattern: `a-zA-Z0-9*`.

If it is set, the product is not available for SearchService.Search after current timestamp plus ttl. However, the product can still be retrieved by ProductService.GetProduct and ProductService.ListProducts. |
| `sizes` | `array` | The size of the product. To represent different size systems or size types, consider using this format: [[[size_system:]size_type:]size_value]. For example, in "US:MENS:M", "US" represents size system; "MENS" represents size type; "M" represents size value. In "GIRLS:27", size system is empty; "GIRLS" represents size type; "27" represents size value. In "32 inches", both size system and size type are empty, while size value is "32 inches".

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_get` | `SELECT` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId` | Gets a Product. |
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_list` | `SELECT` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Gets a list of Products. |
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_create` | `INSERT` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Creates a Product. |
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_delete` | `DELETE` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId` | Deletes a Product. |
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_import` | `EXEC` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Bulk import of multiple Products. Request processing may be synchronous. Non-existing items are created. Note that it is possible for a subset of the Products to be successfully updated. |
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_patch` | `EXEC` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId` | Updates a Product. |
| `projects_locations_catalogs_branches_products_setInventory` | `EXEC` | `branchesId, catalogsId, locationsId, productsId, projectsId` | Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by GetProduct or ListProducts. When inventory is updated with CreateProduct and UpdateProduct, the specified inventory field value(s) will overwrite any existing value(s) while ignoring the last update time for this field. Furthermore, the last update time for the specified inventory fields will be overwritten to the time of the CreateProduct or UpdateProduct request. If no inventory fields are set in CreateProductRequest.product, then any pre-existing inventory information for this product will be used. If no inventory fields are set in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask, then any existing inventory information will be preserved. Pre-existing inventory information can only be updated with SetInventory, ProductService.AddFulfillmentPlaces, and RemoveFulfillmentPlaces. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Please enable Retail Search on Cloud Console before using this feature. |
