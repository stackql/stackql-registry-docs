## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | The resource name of the document, for example `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`. |
| `fields` | `object` | The document's fields. The map keys represent field names. A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example, `foo_bar_17`. Field names matching the regular expression `__.*__` are reserved. Reserved field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The map keys, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be empty. Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by the simple or quoted field names of the containing fields, delimited by `.`. For example, the structured field `"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}` would be represented by the field path `foo.x&y`. Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be escaped using a `\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and `` `bak\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``. |
| `updateTime` | `string` | Output only. The time at which the document was last changed. This value is initially set to the `create_time` then increases monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query. |
| `createTime` | `string` | Output only. The time at which the document was created. This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query. |
## Methods
