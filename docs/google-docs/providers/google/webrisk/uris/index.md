## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_uris_submit` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Submits a URI suspected of containing malicious content to be reviewed. Returns a google.longrunning.Operation which, once the review is complete, is updated with its result. You can use the [Pub/Sub API] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) to receive notifications for the returned Operation. If the result verifies the existence of malicious content, the site will be added to the [Google's Social Engineering lists] (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6350487/) in order to protect users that could get exposed to this threat in the future. Only allowlisted projects can use this method during Early Access. Please reach out to Sales or your customer engineer to obtain access. |
| `search` | `EXEC` |  | This method is used to check whether a URI is on a given threatList. Multiple threatLists may be searched in a single query. The response will list all requested threatLists the URI was found to match. If the URI is not found on any of the requested ThreatList an empty response will be returned. |
