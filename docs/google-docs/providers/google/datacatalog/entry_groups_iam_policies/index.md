## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `etag` | `string` | `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. |
| `version` | `integer` | Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). |
| `bindings` | `array` | Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_entryGroups_getIamPolicy` | `SELECT` | `entryGroupsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Gets the access control policy for a resource. May return: * A`NOT_FOUND` error if the resource doesn't exist or you don't have the permission to view it. * An empty policy if the resource exists but doesn't have a set policy. Supported resources are: - Tag templates - Entry groups Note: This method doesn't get policies from Google Cloud Platform resources ingested into Data Catalog. To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.getIamPolicy` to get policies on tag templates. - `datacatalog.entryGroups.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entry groups. |
| `projects_locations_entryGroups_setIamPolicy` | `EXEC` | `entryGroupsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Sets an access control policy for a resource. Replaces any existing policy. Supported resources are: - Tag templates - Entry groups Note: This method sets policies only within Data Catalog and can't be used to manage policies in BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataproc Metastore, and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced with the Data Catalog. To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.setIamPolicy` to set policies on tag templates. - `datacatalog.entryGroups.setIamPolicy` to set policies on entry groups. |
| `projects_locations_entryGroups_testIamPermissions` | `EXEC` | `entryGroupsId, locationsId, projectsId` | Gets your permissions on a resource. Returns an empty set of permissions if the resource doesn't exist. Supported resources are: - Tag templates - Entry groups Note: This method gets policies only within Data Catalog and can't be used to get policies from BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataproc Metastore, and any external Google Cloud Platform resources ingested into Data Catalog. No Google IAM permissions are required to call this method. |
