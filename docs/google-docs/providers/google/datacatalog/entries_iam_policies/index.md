## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="condition" /> | `object` | Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() < 100" Example (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information. |
| <CopyableCode code="members" /> | `array` | Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A single identity in a workforce identity pool. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id}`: All workforce identities in a group. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}`: All workforce identities with a specific attribute value. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/*`: All identities in a workforce identity pool. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A single identity in a workload identity pool. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id}`: A workload identity pool group. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}`: All identities in a workload identity pool with a certain attribute. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/*`: All identities in a workload identity pool. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: Deleted single identity in a workforce identity pool. For example, `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value`. |
| <CopyableCode code="role" /> | `string` | Role that is assigned to the list of `members`, or principals. For example, `roles/viewer`, `roles/editor`, or `roles/owner`. For an overview of the IAM roles and permissions, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview). For a list of the available pre-defined roles, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles). |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_entry_groups_entries_get_iam_policy" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="entriesId, entryGroupsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Gets the access control policy for a resource. May return: * A`NOT_FOUND` error if the resource doesn't exist or you don't have the permission to view it. * An empty policy if the resource exists but doesn't have a set policy. Supported resources are: - Tag templates - Entry groups Note: This method doesn't get policies from Google Cloud Platform resources ingested into Data Catalog. To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.getIamPolicy` to get policies on tag templates. - `datacatalog.entryGroups.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entry groups. |
| <CopyableCode code="projects_locations_entry_groups_entries_test_iam_permissions" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="entriesId, entryGroupsId, locationsId, projectsId" /> | Gets your permissions on a resource. Returns an empty set of permissions if the resource doesn't exist. Supported resources are: - Tag templates - Entry groups Note: This method gets policies only within Data Catalog and can't be used to get policies from BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataproc Metastore, and any external Google Cloud Platform resources ingested into Data Catalog. No Google IAM permissions are required to call this method. |

## `SELECT` examples

Gets the access control policy for a resource. May return: * A`NOT_FOUND` error if the resource doesn't exist or you don't have the permission to view it. * An empty policy if the resource exists but doesn't have a set policy. Supported resources are: - Tag templates - Entry groups Note: This method doesn't get policies from Google Cloud Platform resources ingested into Data Catalog. To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.getIamPolicy` to get policies on tag templates. - `datacatalog.entryGroups.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entry groups.

```sql
SELECT
condition,
members,
role
FROM google.datacatalog.entries_iam_policies
WHERE entriesId = '{{ entriesId }}'
AND entryGroupsId = '{{ entryGroupsId }}'
AND locationsId = '{{ locationsId }}'
AND projectsId = '{{ projectsId }}';
