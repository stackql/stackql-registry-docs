## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | Required. The format will be projects/{project_number}/feeds/{client-assigned_feed_identifier} or folders/{folder_number}/feeds/{client-assigned_feed_identifier} or organizations/{organization_number}/feeds/{client-assigned_feed_identifier} The client-assigned feed identifier must be unique within the parent project/folder/organization. |
| `assetNames` | `array` | A list of the full names of the assets to receive updates. You must specify either or both of asset_names and asset_types. Only asset updates matching specified asset_names or asset_types are exported to the feed. Example: `//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1`. For a list of the full names for supported asset types, see [Resource name format](/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format). |
| `assetTypes` | `array` | A list of types of the assets to receive updates. You must specify either or both of asset_names and asset_types. Only asset updates matching specified asset_names or asset_types are exported to the feed. Example: `"compute.googleapis.com/Disk"` For a list of all supported asset types, see [Supported asset types](/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types). |
| `condition` | `object` | Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() &lt; 100" Example (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information. |
| `contentType` | `string` | Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name and type will be returned. |
| `feedOutputConfig` | `object` | Output configuration for asset feed destination. |
| `relationshipTypes` | `array` | A list of relationship types to output, for example: `INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP`. This field should only be specified if content_type=RELATIONSHIP. * If specified: it outputs specified relationship updates on the [asset_names] or the [asset_types]. It returns an error if any of the [relationship_types] doesn't belong to the supported relationship types of the [asset_names] or [asset_types], or any of the [asset_names] or the [asset_types] doesn't belong to the source types of the [relationship_types]. * Otherwise: it outputs the supported relationships of the types of [asset_names] and [asset_types] or returns an error if any of the [asset_names] or the [asset_types] has no replationship support. See [Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/overview) for all supported asset types and relationship types. |
