| `channelPartnerId` | `string` | Cloud Identity ID of the customer's channel partner. Populated only if a channel partner exists for this customer. |
| `alternateEmail` | `string` | Secondary contact email. You need to provide an alternate email to create different domains if a primary contact email already exists. Users will receive a notification with credentials when you create an admin.google.com account. Secondary emails are also recovery email addresses. Alternate emails are optional when you create Team customers. |

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.
