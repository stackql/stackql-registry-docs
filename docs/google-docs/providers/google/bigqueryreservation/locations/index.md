## Fields
`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource and then invoke a supported method using the `EXEC` command  
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `projects_locations_searchAllAssignments` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Looks up assignments for a specified resource for a particular region. If the request is about a project: 1. Assignments created on the project will be returned if they exist. 2. Otherwise assignments created on the closest ancestor will be returned. 3. Assignments for different JobTypes will all be returned. The same logic applies if the request is about a folder. If the request is about an organization, then assignments created on the organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors). Comparing to ListAssignments, there are some behavior differences: 1. permission on the assignee will be verified in this API. 2. Hierarchy lookup (project-&gt;folder-&gt;organization) happens in this API. 3. Parent here is `projects/*/locations/*`, instead of `projects/*/locations/*reservations/*`. |

| `projects_locations_updateBiReservation` | `EXEC` | `locationsId, projectsId` | Updates a BI reservation. Only fields specified in the `field_mask` are updated. A singleton BI reservation always exists with default size 0. In order to reserve BI capacity it needs to be updated to an amount greater than 0. In order to release BI capacity reservation size must be set to 0. |
