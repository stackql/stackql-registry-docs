## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique identifier for the debuggee generated by the controller service. |
| `description` | `string` | Human readable description of the debuggee. Including a human-readable project name, environment name and version information is recommended. |
| `uniquifier` | `string` | Uniquifier to further distinguish the application. It is possible that different applications might have identical values in the debuggee message, thus, incorrectly identified as a single application by the Controller service. This field adds salt to further distinguish the application. Agents should consider seeding this field with value that identifies the code, binary, configuration and environment. |
| `isInactive` | `boolean` | If set to `true`, indicates that Controller service does not detect any activity from the debuggee agents and the application is possibly stopped. |
| `canaryMode` | `string` | Used when setting breakpoint canary for this debuggee. |
| `extSourceContexts` | `array` | References to the locations and revisions of the source code used in the deployed application. |
| `sourceContexts` | `array` | References to the locations and revisions of the source code used in the deployed application. |
| `project` | `string` | Project the debuggee is associated with. Use project number or id when registering a Google Cloud Platform project. |
| `isDisabled` | `boolean` | If set to `true`, indicates that the agent should disable itself and detach from the debuggee. |
| `status` | `object` | Represents a contextual status message. The message can indicate an error or informational status, and refer to specific parts of the containing object. For example, the `Breakpoint.status` field can indicate an error referring to the `BREAKPOINT_SOURCE_LOCATION` with the message `Location not found`. |
| `agentVersion` | `string` | Version ID of the agent. Schema: `domain/language-platform/vmajor.minor` (for example `google.com/java-gcp/v1.1`). |
| `labels` | `object` | A set of custom debuggee properties, populated by the agent, to be displayed to the user. |
