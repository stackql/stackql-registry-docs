| <CopyableCode code="sourceInstantSnapshotId" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The unique ID of the instant snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact instant snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an instant snapshot that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source instant snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the instant snapshot that was used. |
| <CopyableCode code="sourceSnapshot" /> | `string` | The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are valid values: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project /global/snapshots/snapshot - projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot - global/snapshots/snapshot  |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="aggregated_list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Retrieves an aggregated list of persistent disks. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`. |
| <CopyableCode code="get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="disk, project, zone" /> | Returns the specified persistent disk. |
| <CopyableCode code="list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project, zone" /> | Retrieves a list of persistent disks contained within the specified zone. |
| <CopyableCode code="bulk_insert" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="project, zone" /> | Bulk create a set of disks. |
| <CopyableCode code="insert" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="project, zone" /> | Creates a persistent disk in the specified project using the data in the request. You can create a disk from a source (sourceImage, sourceSnapshot, or sourceDisk) or create an empty 500 GB data disk by omitting all properties. You can also create a disk that is larger than the default size by specifying the sizeGb property. |
| <CopyableCode code="delete" /> | `DELETE` | <CopyableCode code="disk, project, zone" /> | Deletes the specified persistent disk. Deleting a disk removes its data permanently and is irreversible.

| <CopyableCode code="set_labels" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="project, resource, zone" /> | Sets the labels on a disk. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling Resources documentation. |
| <CopyableCode code="start_async_replication" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="disk, project, zone" /> | Starts asynchronous replication. Must be invoked on the primary disk. |
| <CopyableCode code="stop_async_replication" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="disk, project, zone" /> | Stops asynchronous replication. Can be invoked either on the primary or on the secondary disk. |
| <CopyableCode code="stop_group_async_replication" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="project, zone" /> | Stops asynchronous replication for a consistency group of disks. Can be invoked either in the primary or secondary scope. |
