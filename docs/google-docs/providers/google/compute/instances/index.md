| `detach_disk` | `EXEC` | `deviceName, instance, project, zone` | Detaches a disk from an instance. |
| `reset` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Performs a reset on the instance. This is a hard reset. The VM does not do a graceful shutdown. For more information, see Resetting an instance. |
| `resume` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Resumes an instance that was suspended using the instances().suspend method. |
| `send_diagnostic_interrupt` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Sends diagnostic interrupt to the instance. |

| `set_disk_auto_delete` | `EXEC` | `autoDelete, deviceName, instance, project, zone` | Sets the auto-delete flag for a disk attached to an instance. |
| `set_labels` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Sets labels on an instance. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling Resources documentation. |
| `set_machine_resources` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Changes the number and/or type of accelerator for a stopped instance to the values specified in the request. |
| `set_machine_type` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Changes the machine type for a stopped instance to the machine type specified in the request. |

| `set_name` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Sets name of an instance. |
| `set_scheduling` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Sets an instance's scheduling options. You can only call this method on a stopped instance, that is, a VM instance that is in a `TERMINATED` state. See Instance Life Cycle for more information on the possible instance states. For more information about setting scheduling options for a VM, see Set VM host maintenance policy. |
| `set_service_account` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Sets the service account on the instance. For more information, read Changing the service account and access scopes for an instance. |

| `start_with_encryption_key` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Starts an instance that was stopped using the instances().stop method. For more information, see Restart an instance. |
| `stop` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Stops a running instance, shutting it down cleanly, and allows you to restart the instance at a later time. Stopped instances do not incur VM usage charges while they are stopped. However, resources that the VM is using, such as persistent disks and static IP addresses, will continue to be charged until they are deleted. For more information, see Stopping an instance. |
| `suspend` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | This method suspends a running instance, saving its state to persistent storage, and allows you to resume the instance at a later time. Suspended instances have no compute costs (cores or RAM), and incur only storage charges for the saved VM memory and localSSD data. Any charged resources the virtual machine was using, such as persistent disks and static IP addresses, will continue to be charged while the instance is suspended. For more information, see Suspending and resuming an instance. |
| `update` | `EXEC` | `instance, project, zone` | Updates an instance only if the necessary resources are available. This method can update only a specific set of instance properties. See Updating a running instance for a list of updatable instance properties. |
