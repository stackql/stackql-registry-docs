## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | `string` | [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. |
| `name` | `string` | Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. |
| `description` | `string` | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. |
| `interfaces` | `array` | A list of interfaces for this external VPN gateway. If your peer-side gateway is an on-premises gateway and non-AWS cloud providers' gateway, at most two interfaces can be provided for an external VPN gateway. If your peer side is an AWS virtual private gateway, four interfaces should be provided for an external VPN gateway. |
| `labels` | `object` | Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with RFC1035. Label values may be empty. |
| `redundancyType` | `string` | Indicates the user-supplied redundancy type of this external VPN gateway. |
| `selfLink` | `string` | [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. |
| `creationTimestamp` | `string` | [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
| `kind` | `string` | [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#externalVpnGateway for externalVpnGateways. |
| `labelFingerprint` | `string` | A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this ExternalVpnGateway, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve an ExternalVpnGateway. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `externalVpnGateways_get` | `SELECT` | `externalVpnGateway, project` | Returns the specified externalVpnGateway. Get a list of available externalVpnGateways by making a list() request. |
| `externalVpnGateways_list` | `SELECT` | `project` | Retrieves the list of ExternalVpnGateway available to the specified project. |
| `externalVpnGateways_insert` | `INSERT` | `project` | Creates a ExternalVpnGateway in the specified project using the data included in the request. |
| `externalVpnGateways_delete` | `DELETE` | `externalVpnGateway, project` | Deletes the specified externalVpnGateway. |
| `externalVpnGateways_setLabels` | `EXEC` | `project, resource` | Sets the labels on an ExternalVpnGateway. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling Resources documentation. |
