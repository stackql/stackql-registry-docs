## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="id" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. |
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | Name of the resource. For Organization Firewall Policies it's a [Output Only] numeric ID allocated by Google Cloud which uniquely identifies the Organization Firewall Policy. |
| <CopyableCode code="description" /> | `string` | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="associations" /> | `array` | A list of associations that belong to this firewall policy. |
| <CopyableCode code="creationTimestamp" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
| <CopyableCode code="displayName" /> | `string` | Deprecated, please use short name instead. User-provided name of the Organization firewall policy. The name should be unique in the organization in which the firewall policy is created. This field is not applicable to network firewall policies. This name must be set on creation and cannot be changed. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. |
| <CopyableCode code="fingerprint" /> | `string` | Specifies a fingerprint for this resource, which is essentially a hash of the metadata's contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the firewall policy. |
| <CopyableCode code="kind" /> | `string` | [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewallPolicyfor firewall policies |
| <CopyableCode code="parent" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The parent of the firewall policy. This field is not applicable to network firewall policies. |
| <CopyableCode code="region" /> | `string` | [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional firewall policy resides. This field is not applicable to global firewall policies. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body. |
| <CopyableCode code="ruleTupleCount" /> | `integer` | [Output Only] Total count of all firewall policy rule tuples. A firewall policy can not exceed a set number of tuples. |
| <CopyableCode code="rules" /> | `array` | A list of rules that belong to this policy. There must always be a default rule (rule with priority 2147483647 and match "*"). If no rules are provided when creating a firewall policy, a default rule with action "allow" will be added. |
| <CopyableCode code="selfLink" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="selfLinkWithId" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with the resource id. |
| <CopyableCode code="shortName" /> | `string` | User-provided name of the Organization firewall policy. The name should be unique in the organization in which the firewall policy is created. This field is not applicable to network firewall policies. This name must be set on creation and cannot be changed. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. |
