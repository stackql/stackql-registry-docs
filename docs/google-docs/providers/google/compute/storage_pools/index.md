## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="id" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. |
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. |
| <CopyableCode code="description" /> | `string` | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="capacityProvisioningType" /> | `string` | Provisioning type of the byte capacity of the pool. |
| <CopyableCode code="creationTimestamp" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
| <CopyableCode code="kind" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#storagePool for storage pools. |
| <CopyableCode code="labelFingerprint" /> | `string` | A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this storage pool, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a storage pool. |
| <CopyableCode code="labels" /> | `object` | Labels to apply to this storage pool. These can be later modified by the setLabels method. |
| <CopyableCode code="performanceProvisioningType" /> | `string` | Provisioning type of the performance-related parameters of the pool, such as throughput and IOPS. |
| <CopyableCode code="poolProvisionedCapacityGb" /> | `string` | Size, in GiB, of the storage pool. |
| <CopyableCode code="poolProvisionedIops" /> | `string` | Provisioned IOPS of the storage pool. Only relevant if the storage pool type is hyperdisk-balanced. |
| <CopyableCode code="poolProvisionedThroughput" /> | `string` | Provisioned throughput of the storage pool. Only relevant if the storage pool type is hyperdisk-balanced or hyperdisk-throughput. |
| <CopyableCode code="resourceStatus" /> | `object` | [Output Only] Contains output only fields. |
| <CopyableCode code="selfLink" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="selfLinkWithId" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource's resource id. |
| <CopyableCode code="state" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The status of storage pool creation. - CREATING: Storage pool is provisioning. storagePool. - FAILED: Storage pool creation failed. - READY: Storage pool is ready for use. - DELETING: Storage pool is deleting.  |
| <CopyableCode code="status" /> | `object` | [Output Only] Contains output only fields. |
| <CopyableCode code="storagePoolType" /> | `string` | Type of the storage pool. |
| <CopyableCode code="zone" /> | `string` | [Output Only] URL of the zone where the storage pool resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="aggregated_list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Retrieves an aggregated list of storage pools. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`. |
| <CopyableCode code="get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project, storagePool, zone" /> | Returns a specified storage pool. Gets a list of available storage pools by making a list() request. |
| <CopyableCode code="list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project, zone" /> | Retrieves a list of storage pools contained within the specified zone. |
| <CopyableCode code="insert" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="project, zone" /> | Creates a storage pool in the specified project using the data in the request. |
| <CopyableCode code="delete" /> | `DELETE` | <CopyableCode code="project, storagePool, zone" /> | Deletes the specified storage pool. Deleting a storagePool removes its data permanently and is irreversible. However, deleting a storagePool does not delete any snapshots previously made from the storagePool. You must separately delete snapshots. |
| <CopyableCode code="_aggregated_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Retrieves an aggregated list of storage pools. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`. |
| <CopyableCode code="update" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="project, storagePool, zone" /> | Updates the specified storagePool with the data included in the request. The update is performed only on selected fields included as part of update-mask. Only the following fields can be modified: size_tb and provisioned_iops. |
