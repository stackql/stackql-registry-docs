Creates, updates, deletes, gets or lists a <code>regions</code> resource.

## Overview

<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><CopyableCode code="google.compute.regions" /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="id" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. |
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Name of the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="description" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Textual description of the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="creationTimestamp" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
| <CopyableCode code="deprecated" /> | `object` | Deprecation status for a public resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="kind" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#region for regions. |
| <CopyableCode code="quotaStatusWarning" /> | `object` | [Output Only] Warning of fetching the `quotas` field for this region. This field is populated only if fetching of the `quotas` field fails. |
| <CopyableCode code="quotas" /> | `array` | [Output Only] Quotas assigned to this region. |
| <CopyableCode code="selfLink" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="status" /> | `string` | [Output Only] Status of the region, either UP or DOWN. |
| <CopyableCode code="supportsPzs" /> | `boolean` | [Output Only] Reserved for future use. |
| <CopyableCode code="zones" /> | `array` | [Output Only] A list of zones available in this region, in the form of resource URLs. |

## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project, region" /> | Returns the specified Region resource. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request. This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region and if the organization policy constraint compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region. It is recommended to use the default setting for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed behaviour for this method. |
| <CopyableCode code="list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Retrieves the list of region resources available to the specified project. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `items.quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request. This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region and if the organization policy constraint compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region.

## `SELECT` examples

Retrieves the list of region resources available to the specified project. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `items.quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request. This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region and if the organization policy constraint compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region. It is recommended to use the default setting for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed behaviour for this method.
