## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `id` | `string` | [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. |
| `name` | `string` | Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. |
| `description` | `string` | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. |
| `customerName` | `string` | Customer name, to put in the Letter of Authorization as the party authorized to request a crossconnect. |
| `selfLink` | `string` | [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. |
| `linkType` | `string` | Type of link requested, which can take one of the following values: - LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR: A 10G Ethernet with LR optics - LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_100G_LR: A 100G Ethernet with LR optics. Note that this field indicates the speed of each of the links in the bundle, not the speed of the entire bundle. |
| `labels` | `object` | Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with RFC1035. Label values may be empty. |
| `circuitInfos` | `array` | [Output Only] A list of CircuitInfo objects, that describe the individual circuits in this LAG. |
| `kind` | `string` | [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#interconnect for interconnects. |
| `googleReferenceId` | `string` | [Output Only] Google reference ID to be used when raising support tickets with Google or otherwise to debug backend connectivity issues. |
| `satisfiesPzs` | `boolean` | [Output Only] Reserved for future use. |
| `requestedLinkCount` | `integer` | Target number of physical links in the link bundle, as requested by the customer. |
| `nocContactEmail` | `string` | Email address to contact the customer NOC for operations and maintenance notifications regarding this Interconnect. If specified, this will be used for notifications in addition to all other forms described, such as Cloud Monitoring logs alerting and Cloud Notifications. This field is required for users who sign up for Cloud Interconnect using workforce identity federation. |
| `state` | `string` | [Output Only] The current state of Interconnect functionality, which can take one of the following values: - ACTIVE: The Interconnect is valid, turned up and ready to use. Attachments may be provisioned on this Interconnect. - UNPROVISIONED: The Interconnect has not completed turnup. No attachments may be provisioned on this Interconnect. - UNDER_MAINTENANCE: The Interconnect is undergoing internal maintenance. No attachments may be provisioned or updated on this Interconnect.  |
| `googleIpAddress` | `string` | [Output Only] IP address configured on the Google side of the Interconnect link. This can be used only for ping tests. |
| `provisionedLinkCount` | `integer` | [Output Only] Number of links actually provisioned in this interconnect. |
| `location` | `string` | URL of the InterconnectLocation object that represents where this connection is to be provisioned. |
| `expectedOutages` | `array` | [Output Only] A list of outages expected for this Interconnect. |
| `labelFingerprint` | `string` | A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this Interconnect, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve an Interconnect. |
| `interconnectAttachments` | `array` | [Output Only] A list of the URLs of all InterconnectAttachments configured to use this Interconnect. |
| `peerIpAddress` | `string` | [Output Only] IP address configured on the customer side of the Interconnect link. The customer should configure this IP address during turnup when prompted by Google NOC. This can be used only for ping tests. |
| `adminEnabled` | `boolean` | Administrative status of the interconnect. When this is set to true, the Interconnect is functional and can carry traffic. When set to false, no packets can be carried over the interconnect and no BGP routes are exchanged over it. By default, the status is set to true. |
| `interconnectType` | `string` | Type of interconnect, which can take one of the following values: - PARTNER: A partner-managed interconnection shared between customers though a partner. - DEDICATED: A dedicated physical interconnection with the customer. Note that a value IT_PRIVATE has been deprecated in favor of DEDICATED. |
| `remoteLocation` | `string` | Indicates that this is a Cross-Cloud Interconnect. This field specifies the location outside of Google's network that the interconnect is connected to. |
| `creationTimestamp` | `string` | [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. |
| `operationalStatus` | `string` | [Output Only] The current status of this Interconnect's functionality, which can take one of the following values: - OS_ACTIVE: A valid Interconnect, which is turned up and is ready to use. Attachments may be provisioned on this Interconnect. - OS_UNPROVISIONED: An Interconnect that has not completed turnup. No attachments may be provisioned on this Interconnect. - OS_UNDER_MAINTENANCE: An Interconnect that is undergoing internal maintenance. No attachments may be provisioned or updated on this Interconnect.  |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `interconnect, project` | Returns the specified Interconnect. Get a list of available Interconnects by making a list() request. |
| `list` | `SELECT` | `project` | Retrieves the list of Interconnects available to the specified project. |
| `insert` | `INSERT` | `project` | Creates an Interconnect in the specified project using the data included in the request. |
| `delete` | `DELETE` | `interconnect, project` | Deletes the specified Interconnect. |
| `patch` | `EXEC` | `interconnect, project` | Updates the specified Interconnect with the data included in the request. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules. |
| `set_labels` | `EXEC` | `project, resource` | Sets the labels on an Interconnect. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling Resources documentation. |
