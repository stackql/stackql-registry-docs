## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="id" /> | `string` | [Output Only] A unique identifier for this instance group, generated by the server. |
| <CopyableCode code="name" /> | `string` | The name of the instance group. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. |
| <CopyableCode code="description" /> | `string` | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. |
| <CopyableCode code="creationTimestamp" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The creation timestamp for this instance group in RFC3339 text format. |
| <CopyableCode code="fingerprint" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The fingerprint of the named ports. The system uses this fingerprint to detect conflicts when multiple users change the named ports concurrently. |
| <CopyableCode code="kind" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The resource type, which is always compute#instanceGroup for instance groups. |
| <CopyableCode code="namedPorts" /> | `array` |  Assigns a name to a port number. For example: &#123;name: "http", port: 80&#125; This allows the system to reference ports by the assigned name instead of a port number. Named ports can also contain multiple ports. For example: [&#123;name: "app1", port: 8080&#125;, &#123;name: "app1", port: 8081&#125;, &#123;name: "app2", port: 8082&#125;] Named ports apply to all instances in this instance group.  |
| <CopyableCode code="network" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The URL of the network to which all instances in the instance group belong. If your instance has multiple network interfaces, then the network and subnetwork fields only refer to the network and subnet used by your primary interface (nic0). |
| <CopyableCode code="region" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The URL of the region where the instance group is located (for regional resources). |
| <CopyableCode code="selfLink" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The URL for this instance group. The server generates this URL. |
| <CopyableCode code="size" /> | `integer` | [Output Only] The total number of instances in the instance group. |
| <CopyableCode code="subnetwork" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The URL of the subnetwork to which all instances in the instance group belong. If your instance has multiple network interfaces, then the network and subnetwork fields only refer to the network and subnet used by your primary interface (nic0). |
| <CopyableCode code="zone" /> | `string` | [Output Only] The URL of the zone where the instance group is located (for zonal resources). |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| <CopyableCode code="aggregated_list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Retrieves the list of instance groups and sorts them by zone. |
| <CopyableCode code="get" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="instanceGroup, project, zone" /> | Returns the specified zonal instance group. Get a list of available zonal instance groups by making a list() request. For managed instance groups, use the instanceGroupManagers or regionInstanceGroupManagers methods instead. |
| <CopyableCode code="list" /> | `SELECT` | <CopyableCode code="project, zone" /> | Retrieves the list of zonal instance group resources contained within the specified zone. For managed instance groups, use the instanceGroupManagers or regionInstanceGroupManagers methods instead. |
| <CopyableCode code="insert" /> | `INSERT` | <CopyableCode code="project, zone" /> | Creates an instance group in the specified project using the parameters that are included in the request. |
| <CopyableCode code="delete" /> | `DELETE` | <CopyableCode code="instanceGroup, project, zone" /> | Deletes the specified instance group. The instances in the group are not deleted. Note that instance group must not belong to a backend service. Read Deleting an instance group for more information. |
| <CopyableCode code="_aggregated_list" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="project" /> | Retrieves the list of instance groups and sorts them by zone. |
| <CopyableCode code="set_named_ports" /> | `EXEC` | <CopyableCode code="instanceGroup, project, zone" /> | Sets the named ports for the specified instance group. |
