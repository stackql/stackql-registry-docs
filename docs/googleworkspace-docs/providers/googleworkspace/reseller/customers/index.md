## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `customerId` | `string` | This property will always be returned in a response as the unique identifier generated by Google. In a request, this property can be either the primary domain or the unique identifier generated by Google. |
| `customerDomainVerified` | `boolean` | Whether the customer's primary domain has been verified. |
| `phoneNumber` | `string` | Customer contact phone number. Must start with "+" followed by the country code. The rest of the number can be contiguous numbers or respect the phone local format conventions, but it must be a real phone number and not, for example, "123". This field is silently ignored if invalid. |
| `primaryAdmin` | `object` | JSON template for primary admin in case of TEAM customers |
| `customerDomain` | `string` | The customer's primary domain name string. `customerDomain` is required when creating a new customer. Do not include the `www` prefix in the domain when adding a customer. |
| `postalAddress` | `object` | JSON template for address of a customer. |
| `resourceUiUrl` | `string` | URL to customer's Admin console dashboard. The read-only URL is generated by the API service. This is used if your client application requires the customer to complete a task in the Admin console. |
| `alternateEmail` | `string` | Like the "Customer email" in the reseller tools, this email is the secondary contact used if something happens to the customer's service such as service outage or a security issue. This property is required when creating a new "domain" customer and should not use the same domain as `customerDomain`. The `alternateEmail` field is not necessary to create a "team" customer. |
| `customerType` | `string` | Identifies the type of the customer. Acceptable values include: * `domain`: Implies a domain-verified customer (default). * `team`: Implies an email-verified customer. For more information, see [managed teams](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9939479). |
| `kind` | `string` | Identifies the resource as a customer. Value: `reseller#customer` |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `customerId` | Gets a customer account. Use this operation to see a customer account already in your reseller management, or to see the minimal account information for an existing customer that you do not manage. For more information about the API response for existing customers, see [retrieving a customer account](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#get_customer). |
| `insert` | `INSERT` |  | Orders a new customer's account. Before ordering a new customer account, establish whether the customer account already exists using the [`customers.get`](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/reference/customers/get) If the customer account exists as a direct Google account or as a resold customer account from another reseller, use the `customerAuthToken\` as described in [order a resold account for an existing customer](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#create_existing_customer). For more information about ordering a new customer account, see [order a new customer account](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#create_customer). After creating a new customer account, you must provision a user as an administrator. The customer's administrator is required to sign in to the Admin console and sign the G Suite via Reseller agreement to activate the account. Resellers are prohibited from signing the G Suite via Reseller agreement on the customer's behalf. For more information, see [order a new customer account](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#tos). |
| `patch` | `EXEC` | `customerId` | Updates a customer account's settings. This method supports patch semantics. You cannot update `customerType` via the Reseller API, but a `"team"` customer can verify their domain and become `customerType = "domain"`. For more information, see [Verify your domain to unlock Essentials features](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9122284). |
| `update` | `EXEC` | `customerId` | Updates a customer account's settings. You cannot update `customerType` via the Reseller API, but a `"team"` customer can verify their domain and become `customerType = "domain"`. For more information, see [update a customer's settings](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#update_customer). |
